# Nama ERP Installation Guide

**Nama ERP** is a Java-based web application that runs on Apache Tomcat and uses Microsoft SQL Server as its default database engine.

## System Requirements

* **Operating System:** 64-bit (Windows Server recommended)
* **Java JDK:** Version 21 or higher
  [Download JDK 21](https://www.oracle.com/eg/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows)
* **Apache Tomcat:** Version 10
  [Download Tomcat 10](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi)
* **Database Engine:** Microsoft SQL Server 2016 or higher (SQL Server 2022 recommended)
  For test environments, use **SQL Server Developer Edition**
  [Download SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
* **SQL Server Management Studio**
  [Download SQL Server Management Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/install/install#:~:text=Download%20SSMS)
* **7-Zip** (for handling compressed files)
  [Download 7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
* **Notepad++** (for viewing logs or editing configuration files)
  [Download Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
* **Nama ERP Installer**
  [Download Installer](https://namasoft.com/bin/installer/installer.zip)

## Database Setup

* Enable **Mixed Mode Authentication** in SQL Server.
* Create a database (avoid using the default name `namaerp` in production).
* Create a SQL user (or use `sa`) and grant full access to the database.
* Enable **TCP/IP Protocol** using **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.
* For **named instances**, assign a static port using the **IPAll** settings.

::: tip If you are installing SQL Server on a modern SSD drive, you might face an issue after the installation 
**Sample Log content** (Log is usually in `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Log\ERRORLOG` )
```log
Error: 5179, Severity: 16, State: 1.
Cannot use file 'data file path', because it is on a volume with sector size 8192. SQL Server supports a maximum sector size of 4096 bytes. Move the file to a volume with a compatible sector size.
```
* Solution:
    1. Unistall SQL Server
    2. Run the following powershell script:
```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\stornvme\Parameters\Device" -Name   "ForcedPhysicalSectorSizeInBytes" -PropertyType MultiString        -Force -Value "* 4095"
```
    3. Restart Windows
    3. Install SQL Server again

## Using the Installer

The **Nama ERP Installer** provides a graphical interface with the following key features:

### Core Installation Features
* Creating database and database users
* Generating SQL Server Agent **full backup job**
* Creating **differential backup job** (runs every 2–3 hours)
* Generating **backup cleanup script** (removes old backups)
* Option to **upload backups to cloud storage** (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.)
* Automatic **SSL certificate** creation using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

### Interface Sections
1. **License Information**: License key, customer name, sub-server (auto-populated)
2. **Database Configuration**: Server, port (1433), database name, credentials
3. **Server Configuration**: Tomcat path (auto-detected), server address
4. **Installation Paths**: Extras.zip URL/path, download destination
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time status, logs, and progress bars

### Smart Features
* **Auto-detection**: Common Tomcat paths, existing configurations
* **Real-time validation**: Visual feedback (green/red borders) for field inputs
* **Configuration persistence**: Auto-save/restore settings via `installer.properties`
* **License key integration**: Automatic customer/sub-server population

## SSL Certificate Requirements

To install SSL with Let's Encrypt, you need:

1. A **static IP address**
2. A **domain name** that points to the static IP
3. **Port forwarding** for ports `80` and `443` from your router to your server

::: tip
If a static IP is not available, you can use a **Dynamic DNS service** (e.g., selfip, DDNS).

## Supported Databases

While SQL Server is the default, other databases may be supported. Please contact Nama ERP technical support for confirmation before using alternatives.

## Confirming Nama ERP Installation

By default, Apache Tomcat runs on port `8080`. If you did not change the port during setup, you can confirm that Nama ERP is installed correctly by visiting:

```
http://localhost:8080/erp/
```

If the login page appears, the installation was successful.

To allow access for other users on your local network (LAN), make sure port `8080` is open in **Windows Firewall**:

* Go to **Windows Defender Firewall** > **Advanced Settings**
* Under **Inbound Rules**, create a new rule to allow traffic on port `8080`

## Upgrading Nama ERP

You can upgrade Nama ERP from the **utils page** within the system interface. Multiple upgrade methods are available depending on your setup.

### Manual Upgrade

To upgrade Nama ERP manually:

1. Download the upgrade tool:
   [https://namasoft.com/bin/upg-wget.jar](https://namasoft.com/bin/upg-wget.jar)

2. Copy the file into your **Tomcat installation folder**

3. You can run the JAR file by:

    * **Double-clicking** it
      **OR**
    * Using **Windows Command Prompt**:

      #### Steps:

        * Open Command Prompt (`cmd`)

        * Navigate to your Tomcat installation folder using the `cd` command, for example:

          ```cmd
          cd "C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 10"
          ```

        * Run the upgrade tool:

          ```cmd
          java -jar upg-wget.jar
          ```

This tool will automatically download and apply the latest Nama ERP updates.

### How to Allow Downloading Releases from Utils Page?

To enable the system to download and install updates from the **utils** page (i.e., support self-upgrade functionality), the Tomcat service must run under the **Local System Account**.

::: tip
 This configuration is typically set automatically during the Nama ERP installation. If auto-upgrade stops functioning, follow these steps to restore it
:::

1. Open the **Tomcat Service Configuration Utility**:

    * Navigate to:
      `C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 10\bin\tomcatw.exe`
    * Or search in the Windows Start Menu for: **Configure Tomcat**

2. In the configuration window, go to the **Log On** tab.

3. Select the radio option **Local System account**.

4. Save the configuration and restart the Tomcat service.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Pre-Installation Validation**: Use **Perform Checks** (F5) to diagnose problems:

1. **Port Conflicts**: Another program using Tomcat's port (usually 8080)
2. **Database Problems**: SQL Server not running, TCP/IP disabled, or incorrect credentials  
3. **Java Issues**: Missing or incorrectly configured Java path
4. **Invalid Paths**: Non-existent Tomcat directory or malformed URLs

### Error Resolution Process
1. **Run Diagnostics** → **Review Logs** → **Fix Fatal Errors** → **Retry Installation**
2. Use **Load From Tomcat** to import existing configurations
3. **Save Config** preserves settings between sessions for troubleshooting
