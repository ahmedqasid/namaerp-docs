# Troubleshooting

A support ticket rarely names the screen it is about. It names a symptom: the system is slow, the
invoice is not in the ledger, the email never arrived, a red message at login, a field that has
vanished. The answers are spread across the whole site, next to the screens they belong to. This
page is the way in from the symptom: find the complaint in the table below, and it points to the
page that explains it.
