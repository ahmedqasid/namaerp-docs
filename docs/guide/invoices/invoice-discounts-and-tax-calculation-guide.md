:::

## Understanding the Calculation Flow

### Basic Calculation Sequence

When an invoice is processed, Nama ERP follows this general calculation sequence:

1. **Line Total Calculation**: Quantity × Unit Price = Line Total
2. **Line Discounts Application**: Apply Discount1 through Discount8 in sequence
3. **Header Discount Application**: Apply single discount to entire invoice
4. **Tax Calculations**: Apply Tax1 through Tax4 at configured points
5. **Final Totals**: Calculate net amounts and remaining balances

::: info Important Note
The exact sequence can be customized through the `effectsConfig` field in TaxConfiguration, allowing for different discount and tax application orders based on business requirements.

## Tax Configuration Resolution System

### Understanding fetchTaxConfiguration Method

The `fetchTaxConfiguration` method in `TaxPlan.java` determines which tax configuration to use through a hierarchical resolution process:

```java
public static TaxConfiguration fetchTaxConfiguration(
    TaxPlan header,      // Header tax plan (from document)
    TaxPlan line,        // Line tax plan (from item/line)
    LegalEntity legalEntity, 
    DateDF valueDate,
    EntityTypeDF entityType)
```

#### Resolution Hierarchy

1. **Header Tax Plan Priority**
   - First checks if header tax plan exists
   - If exists, checks its `defaultTaxConfig` field:
     - **GlobalConfig**: Uses system-wide global configuration
     - **TaxPlanHeader**: Uses configuration from tax plan header
     - **TaxPlanLine**: Uses configuration from legal entity tax lines

2. **Line Tax Plan Fallback**
   - If header plan doesn't provide configuration, checks line tax plan
   - Follows same `defaultTaxConfig` resolution logic

3. **Global Default**
   - If neither plan provides configuration, uses global system configuration

### Tax Plan Configuration Fields

#### Core Tax Plan Fields

### How Discounts Are Calculated

#### Percentage-Based Discounts
```
Discount Amount = (Base Amount × Discount Percentage) ÷ 100
New Total = Base Amount - Discount Amount
```

#### Value-Based Discounts
```
Discount Amount = Fixed Discount Value
New Total = Base Amount - Discount Amount
```

#### Tax-Inclusive Discounts
When taxes are included in the price, the discount calculation adjusts:
```
Discount Amount = Base Amount - (Base Amount × 100) ÷ (100 + Tax Percentage)
```

### Tax as Addition vs Deduction

The system determines whether a tax adds to or subtracts from the invoice total based on the `tax[N]IsDiscount` field:

#### When Tax Adds to Total (Standard Tax)
- **Field Setting**: `tax[N]IsDiscount = false`
- **Calculation**: `New Total = Base Amount + Tax Amount`
- **Use Case**: VAT, GST, Sales Tax
- **Example**: 
  ```
  Line Total: $100
  Tax1 (15%): $15
  Final Total: $100 + $15 = $115
  ```

#### When Tax Reduces Total (Discount Tax)
- **Field Setting**: `tax[N]IsDiscount = true`
- **Calculation**: `New Total = Base Amount - Tax Amount`
- **Use Case**: Withholding Tax, Discount Tax, Rebates
- **Example**:
  ```
  Line Total: $100
  Tax3 (5% withholding): $5
  Final Total: $100 - $5 = $95
  ```

### Tax Calculation Methods

#### Percentage-Based Taxes

**Tax-Exclusive (Added to Price):**
```java
if (!priceIncludesTax && !taxIsDiscount) {
    taxAmount = (baseAmount × taxPercentage) ÷ 100;
    finalAmount = baseAmount + taxAmount;
}
```

**Tax-Inclusive (Included in Price):**
```java
if (priceIncludesTax && !taxIsDiscount) {
    taxAmount = baseAmount - (baseAmount × 100) ÷ (100 + taxPercentage);
    finalAmount = baseAmount; // Price already includes tax
}
```

**Tax as Discount:**
```java
if (taxIsDiscount) {
    taxAmount = (baseAmount × taxPercentage) ÷ 100;
    finalAmount = baseAmount - taxAmount;
}
```

#### Value-Based Taxes

**Per Unit Calculation:**
```java
if (taxIsValue && !taxValueIsForTotal) {
    taxAmount = taxRate × quantity;
}
```

**Total Amount Calculation:**
```java
if (taxIsValue && taxValueIsForTotal) {
    taxAmount = taxRate; // Fixed amount regardless of quantity
}
```

## Advanced Effects Configuration

## Common Scenarios and Examples

### Scenario 1: Standard VAT with Trade Discount

**Configuration:**
- `discount1ApplyType`: TotalPrice
- `tax1Location`: HeaderDiscount
- `priceIncludesTax`: false
- `tax1IsDiscount`: false

**Calculation:**
```
Line Total: $1,000
Discount 1 (10%): $100
After Discount: $900
VAT (15%): $135
Final Total: $900 + $135 = $1,035
```

### Scenario 2: Tax-Inclusive Pricing with Discount

**Configuration:**
- `priceIncludesTax`: true
- `discount1ApplyType`: TotalPrice
- `discount1.considerTax1`: true

**Calculation:**
```
Quoted Price (includes 15% VAT): $1,150
VAT Component: $150
Net Price: $1,000
Discount Base (net): $1,000
Discount (10%): $100
Final Net: $900
Final VAT: $135
Final Total: $1,035
```

### Scenario 3: Withholding Tax Configuration

**Configuration:**
- `tax3IsDiscount`: true (makes it a deduction)
- `tax3Location`: HeaderDiscount
- `tax3NotIncludedInTotal`: false

**Calculation:**
```
Line Total: $1,000
VAT (15%): $150
Subtotal: $1,150
Withholding (5%): $50 (deducted)
Final Total: $1,150 - $50 = $1,100
```

### Scenario 4: Complex Effects Order

**Configuration using TaxDiscountEffectsConfig:**
```
Effect 1: Discount1 (10% trade discount)
Effect 2: Discount2 (5% volume discount)  
Effect 3: Tax1 (15% VAT)
Effect 4: HeaderDiscount ($25 promotional)
Effect 5: Tax3 (3% withholding)
```

**Calculation:**
```
Line Total: $1,000
After Discount1: $900
After Discount2: $855
After Tax1: $855 + $128.25 = $983.25
After Header Discount: $958.25
After Withholding: $958.25 - $28.75 = $929.50
```

## Configuration Best Practices

### Setting Up Tax Plans

1. **Create Base Tax Plans**
   - Set `defaultTaxConfig` to control configuration source
   - Configure `taxConfiguration` with standard settings
   - Define `legalEntityTaxes` for different entities and date ranges

2. **Configure Tax Behavior**
   - Set `tax[N]IsDiscount` correctly for additions vs deductions
   - Configure `priceIncludesTax[N]` based on pricing strategy
   - Set `tax[N]NotIncludedInTotal` for display-only taxes

3. **Set Application Points**
   - Configure `tax[N]Location` for proper sequence
   - Set `tax[N]ApplyType` for correct base calculation
   - Use `effectsConfig` for complex sequences

### Discount Configuration Guidelines

1. **Sequential Discounts**
   - Configure `discount[N]ApplyType` for cascading discounts
   - Use `AfterDiscount[N-1]Price` for sequential application
   - Consider tax effects with `discount[N].considerTax[N]`

2. **Value vs Percentage**
   - Set `calcDisc[N]PercentFromValue` based on business rules
   - Use value-based for fixed discounts
   - Use percentage-based for proportional discounts

### Tax Configuration Validation

Before deploying tax configurations:

1. **Verify Calculation Direction**
   - Check `tax[N]IsDiscount` for correct addition/subtraction
   - Validate `priceIncludesTax[N]` matches pricing strategy

2. **Test Date Ranges**
   - Ensure `effectiveFrom` and `effectiveTo` cover required periods
   - Test rate transitions at date boundaries

3. **Validate Sequences**
   - Confirm `effectsOrder` produces expected results
   - Test with sample data covering all scenarios

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Configuration Issues

#### Issue: Tax Being Added Instead of Deducted

**Check These Fields:**
- `tax[N]IsDiscount`: Should be `true` for deductions
- `tax[N]Location`: Verify calculation point
- `effectsConfig`: Check if custom sequence overrides settings

#### Issue: Incorrect Discount Base

**Check These Fields:**
- `discount[N]ApplyType`: Verify base value selection
- `discount[N].considerTax[N]`: Check tax consideration
- `effectsConfig`: Review custom calculation rules

#### Issue: Tax Not Appearing in Total

**Check These Fields:**
- `tax[N]NotIncludedInTotal`: Should be `false` to include
- `noItemTaxesWithThisPolicy`: Should be `false` for Tax1/Tax2
- `noInvoiceTaxesWithThisPolicy`: Should be `false` for Tax3/Tax4
- Customer/Supplier `tax[N]Exempt`: Check exemption flags

#### Issue: Wrong Tax Rate Applied

**Check Resolution Order:**
1. Header tax plan with matching legal entity and date
2. Line tax plan with matching criteria
3. Global configuration default
4. Verify `priorityPolicyOverCusOrSup` setting

### Validation Rules

The system enforces these validation rules:

1. **Tax Plan Consistency**
   - `itemPlan` and `noItemTaxesWithThisPolicy` cannot both be true
   - Configuration combinations must be mathematically valid

2. **Calculation Integrity**
   - Discount amounts cannot make line totals negative
   - Tax percentages must be within valid ranges
   - Rounding must maintain accuracy

3. **Date Range Validity**
   - Overlapping date ranges for same entity not allowed
   - Effective dates must be logically consistent

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Guidelines

1. **Minimize Effects Configuration Complexity**
   - Use only necessary effect positions
   - Avoid redundant calculations
   - Cache frequently used configurations

2. **Efficient Tax Plan Design**
   - Minimize legal entity tax records
   - Use date ranges effectively
   - Leverage default configurations

3. **Configuration Caching**
   - Tax configurations are cached per invoice
   - Avoid unnecessary tax plan changes
   - Use consistent configurations across similar documents

::: warning Important
Always test configuration changes in a development environment before applying to production systems. Complex discount and tax interactions can have unexpected results, especially when using custom effects configurations.

Compared to other major ERP systems, Nama ERP offers a unique balance of flexibility and simplicity, with its 8-level discount structure, unified tax model, and effects configuration providing capabilities that typically require extensive customization in other systems. While it may not have the extensive ecosystem of SAP or Oracle, or the simplicity of Odoo for basic scenarios, it excels in handling complex discount and tax requirements through configuration rather than customization.

Understanding the field-level configuration options and the tax configuration resolution process is essential for proper system setup and maintenance. The combination of tax plans, configuration objects, and effects ordering provides the flexibility to handle virtually any business requirement while maintaining calculation accuracy and regulatory compliance.
