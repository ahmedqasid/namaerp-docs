## Why does the deferred payment method appear on the payment screen even after enabling the option to hide it from settings?

When the option **"Hide the system's default deferred payment method"** is enabled in the POS settings, the deferred payment method is expected to be hidden from the payment screen.

- Problem:

Despite enabling this option, the deferred payment method continues to appear on the payment screen.

- Reason:

This behavior occurs if the permission "Allow deferred payment" is enabled for the user in the POS permissions settings.

- Solution:

Disable the following permission in the POS permissions settings for the user:

* **Permission name:** Allow deferred payment

This ensures that the setting to hide deferred payment is respected, and the method will no longer appear on the payment screen.

## Q: When closing a shift, the error "Payment method Mada repeated in multi line" appeared. What causes it and how can it be resolved?

**A:**
The reason this error appears is that the payment method (e.g., "Mada") had its properties modified after it was used in actual transactions — specifically, the `'cash method'` property in the payment method definition was changed.
As a result, the same payment method appeared on more than one line when closing the shift: once as a cash method and once as a non-cash method (such as bank or deferred), which caused a duplication that is not allowed.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, use the following utility inside the POS system:

```
com.namasoft.pos.util.plugnplay.POSPaymentMethodToggledCashProperty
```

Pass it the **code of the payment method** where the change occurred.

* The original error message text: `Payment method {0} repeated in multi line`
