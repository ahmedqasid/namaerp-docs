# Security & Permissions

Every ERP deployment runs into the same questions sooner or later: who can log in, who can see customer balances, and why does a Jeddah rep see Riyadh invoices? Nama answers all of these with a layered security model — authentication, type-level permissions, record-level visibility, and fine-grained field and page control. Start with the overview to see how the pieces fit, then dive into the page that matches what you need to lock down.
