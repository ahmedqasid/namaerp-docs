# Point of Sale

Most of Nama ERP runs in a web browser. **Nama POS** is the exception: a dedicated **desktop application** that runs right on the cash register, with a companion **Captain Order** mobile app for waiters. It is built this way for one simple reason — a point of sale cannot stop selling just because the internet went down.

## Offline-first by design

A shop floor is a demanding place: the connection drops, a busy night brings a queue to the counter, and the customer in front of you still expects a receipt in seconds. So every register keeps its own **local database**, records every sale, return, payment and shift **locally first**, and **syncs** in the background up to the central Nama ERP — flushing any queued documents automatically once the connection returns.

This is the single most important idea about Nama POS, and it has its own page below.
