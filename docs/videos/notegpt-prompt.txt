Create a full VuePress 2-compatible Markdown page that documents the content of this video in complete detail.

 * **Do not summarize** or omit any part of the video — include all explanations, steps, examples, and instructions as they appear.

 * For each section or topic discussed, include a **clear heading** and a **timestamped link** back to the relevant point in the video (use YouTube timestamp links).

 * Format the page properly using VuePress 2 syntax and Markdown best practices, lists, and tip blocks where appropriate.

 * Do not add commentary or interpretation — focus on accurately reflecting the structure and content of the original video.

 * Do not add front-matter

   The goal is to create a **detailed, reference-quality** guide for users who prefer reading over watching the video.
