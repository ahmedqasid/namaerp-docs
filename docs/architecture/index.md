# Architecture

Sooner or later someone in your IT department will ask the question that no feature list answers: *what is this thing, exactly, and what will it do to our servers?* Perhaps a security review board wants to see the design before it approves the purchase. Perhaps a systems administrator has been handed a budget line for a new machine and needs to know what to buy. Perhaps you are simply being asked, in a tender document, to attach "the application and infrastructure architecture".

These pages are that attachment. They describe how Nama ERP is put together, how it is deployed and operated, and how it is secured — written for the people who run servers rather than the people who post invoices.

::: tip Looking for something more specific?
Hardware sizing lives in [System Minimum Requirements](../getting-started/system-minimum-requirements.md), the step-by-step install in the [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation-guide.md), and the programmatic interface in [Nama ERP REST API](../integration/nama-erp-api.md).
