# Creating a Print Template for a Filter Document Screen

[Watch the video](https://youtu.be/q16A05lIC5I)

**A detailed video** explaining how to design a print template for a filter document screen that contains more than one grid (data grid) using the multi-cell grid system - distributing fields, using Merge Center, adjusting positioning, and handling notes and reports.
Every step and detail was documented accurately and sequentially as presented in the video.

## Introduction and Project Overview

**00:00:01**
Welcome everyone. Based on viewer requests, this session explains how to create a print template for a filter document screen that contains more than one grid. We will start by expanding the discussion and adding various headings and points at the beginning of the project.
- Discussing additions and sub-items
- Identifying the main template type
- Working on the core fields and functional requirements.

## Identifying the Core Fields in the Template

**00:01:20**
The template contains two main fields:
- Document number (document code), which represents the identifying code of the document.
- Clearance reason or filter type (e.g., leave, directive, etc.).

Defining these two fields is essential for establishing the basic structure of the template, where details are specified first such as:
- Header Columns Count (number of columns in the header)
- Field positioning type (Grid Positioning Method) - there is a grid system similar to an Excel table that distributes content by columns and rows.

## Explaining the Grid System and Column Distribution

**00:02:05**
- Explaining the differences between Absolute positioning (pixel-precise position) and Grid (data grid, cells and columns built on a spreadsheet-like table).
- Print template columns and arranging the field order so that we start with 10 columns.
- Merging cells (Merge Center) to distribute text across more than one column.

## Distributing Fields in the Template with Examples

**00:03:30**
- How to place the document number and clearance reason on the same row using the Merge Center feature.
- Explaining employee code and employee name fields in related positions.
- Explaining how to use Label and Value for each field and how they are displayed.

## Notes and How to Handle Them

**00:03:54**
- How to import and display document notes.
- Adjusting the coordinates of notes on the Grid so they start from a specific column and row (x=1, y=1).
- Merging cells to center the text (Merge Center).
- Formatting notes so they fill their allocated space as long-form text documentation.

## Adding Extra Fields: Date, Status, and Related Items

**00:05:20**
- Adding a first work start date field and a status field next to the notes.
- Adjusting Position and Width settings for each field so they do not overlap or stack.
- Practical exercise: saving and printing to preview the template.

## Handling Multiple Merged Cells (Lats)

**00:07:30**
- The challenge caused by multiple mixed merged cells and their effect on positioning and splitting.
- Increasing the columns from 10 to 12 to distribute information better and eliminate problems related to decimal measurements.
- Proposing dynamic recalculation of columns using a dedicated button to clean up fields.
