# System Administration

This is the toolkit for keeping a Nama ERP installation healthy. When something goes wrong — a screen hangs, numbers don't add up, costs look off — this is where you find the answers and the queries to fix them. You'll also find the Tempo language manual for crafting dynamic messages, and a deep set of reprocessing utilities for putting inventory, accounting, and module data back in order when it drifts.

## Troubleshooting

When the system misbehaves, start here. These pages walk through diagnosing hangs and answer the questions that come up most often.

## Reprocessing & Utilities

When stored figures fall out of sync, these utilities recompute them and offer ready-made SQL queries to detect and fix problems across inventory, accounting, manufacturing, fixed assets, and more.
