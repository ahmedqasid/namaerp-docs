# Rent Document Terms

A lease is a promise stretched over time. A three-year shop lease at 120,000 a year signed in
September commits the tenant to 360,000, but almost none of that is this year's revenue — and
alongside the rent itself there is a security deposit that is not income at all, a brokerage
commission earned once, a maintenance charge, a water charge, and a collection commission. Each of
those is a separate conversation with the general ledger.

The rent term gives each of them its own page. That is the defining feature of this family: where a
sales term crams every account block onto one long page, a rent term spreads them across eight
numbered pages, one per kind of money. Configuring a lease term is therefore mostly a matter of
walking the pages in order and deciding, page by page, whether this company books that kind of money
at all. Each page corresponds to a value on the lease itself, so it helps to have
[The Rent Contract](/modules/realestate/rent/realestate-rent-contract) open beside the term screen
the first time you configure one.

first for the anatomy of an accounting side, the both-halves-or-nothing rule, the Confiuration List
routing grid and the tax-policy precedence.

::: info Configure by page title, never by field name
The field names behind the rent term pages are legacy and describe entirely different things from
what the pages actually do. If a colleague, an import file or a customisation refers to a rent term
field by its internal name, do not assume it means what it says. **Always identify a rent term
setting by the page it lives on**, exactly as the tab caption reads on screen. Every instruction on
this page is written that way, and so should yours be.

## The eight pages of a rent contract term

| Page | Title on screen | The money it books |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Total contract effect · اساس العقد | The contract's total rent value, the split between recognised and deferred rent, and every behavioural option |
| 1 | Insurrance effect · تاثيرات التأمين | The tenant's security deposit |
| 2 | Commissions effect · تاثيرات السعي | The brokerage commission on the lease |
| 3 | Maintenance effect · تاثيرات الصيانة | The maintenance charge carried on the lease |
| 4 | Water expense effect · تاثيرات مصاريف المياه | The water and utility charge |
| 5 | commission Collection Effect · تاثيرات عمولة التحصيل | The collection commission |
| 6 | Cancel Previuos RentContract · إعدادات إلغاء العقد السابق | The book and term used when a renewal auto-cancels the previous lease |
| 7 | Tax Effects · تأثيرات الضريبة | The tax plan and the two tax account pairs |

The captions on pages 1 and 6 ship with typos ("Insurrance", "Previuos"); they are reproduced here so
you can recognise the tabs on screen.

Pages 1 to 5 each contain nothing but a debit block and a credit block, and each configures one
amount. Leave a page's blocks empty and that amount is simply not booked — which is the normal
configuration for a company that does not charge a water levy or does not pay a collection
commission.

## Page 0 — the contract's own effect

Page 0 does three jobs at once: it books the contract value, it splits the schedule between this year
and later years, and it holds every behavioural option in the family.

### The account blocks

| Block | Books |
|---|---|
| Debit / Credit | The contract's total rent value |
| Income Debit / Income Credit | Installments falling due inside the document's fiscal year |
| Advance Income Debit / Advance Income Credit | Installments falling due in later years |
| Paid Value Debit / Paid Value Credit | Amounts already paid on the contract at the time it is processed |

The income / advance income split is the heart of rent accounting, so it is worth walking a real
case. The 3-year shop lease at 120,000 a year is signed in September and billed quarterly, so its
schedule holds twelve installments of 30,000. When the contract is processed, the two quarters
falling before the fiscal year end go to the income blocks — 60,000 — and the remaining ten quarters,
300,000, go to the advance income blocks. The company's first-year profit and loss shows 60,000 of
rent, not 360,000.

One option refines this further:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| Split Installment Value If It Spans More Than Two Years | An installment whose period starts inside the fiscal year but ends after it is divided pro-rata by day count into two ledger lines, one up to the year end and one after. Deposit, commission, water and maintenance lines are never split — only the rent itself. |

Without it, a quarter running November to January lands wholly in one year or the other. With it,
two thirds of that quarter is this year's income and one third is deferred.

### The behavioural options

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| Rental Contract | Flips the direction of the whole lease. Left off, we are the landlord: only receipt vouchers may be raised from the schedule. Turned on, we are the tenant renting property in, and only payment vouchers are allowed. Get this wrong and users hit a refusal the first time they try to collect. |
| Allow Rent Sold Estate | Off by default, which blocks leasing a unit that is already flagged sold. Turn it on for the sell-then-lease-back case, or when the company manages a unit it has sold to an investor. |
| Shorten Ledger Effect | Merges ledger lines that share an account and analysis, so a twelve-installment lease produces a compact entry instead of one line per installment. |
| Manual Coding | Stops the system numbering the installment lines, so the user types the codes. The setting survives Extend Contract. |
| Pay Installments In Order | Forces collections against the lease to settle installments oldest first. |
| Modifiable Tax | Leaves the tax amounts on the installment grid editable. Off, they are recomputed from the tax policy on every save. |
| Legal Entity Taxes | The term's own tax policy grid. Filled, it wins outright; empty, the module configuration applies. |
| Confiuration List | The per-installment-type routing grid. On a lease this is where you send the current year's and next years' rent to different accounts per charge type. |

Two more options appear on page 0 **only on rent offers and offer cancellations**, in a group of
their own:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| Reservation Status | Reserve or Without Reservation. Picking the term pre-fills the offer's own reservation field, so the term effectively decides whether quoting a unit blocks it. |
| Create Accounting Effects | Off, the offer posts nothing at all — the normal setting for a quotation. A rent contract always posts; only offers can be silenced this way. |

## Generating the accrual ledgers

Also on page 0, in a group of its own, is the block that produces the periodic revenue-recognition
documents. This is where the rent accrual ledger described in
[Rent Installment Accrual Ledgers](/modules/realestate/rent/realestate-rent-accrual-ledger) comes
from — those documents are generated, never typed, and everything about them is decided here rather
than on their own screen.

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| Generate Rent Installment Ledger | The master switch. Off, nothing is generated at all. On, every commit or update of the contract groups the installment lines by period and creates or updates one accrual document per group; a group that becomes empty deletes its document. |
| Rent Ledger Period Type | Daily, Monthly or Yearly. It decides both the grouping and the accrual document's value date. **Leaving it empty means Daily** — one accrual document per distinct installment date, which is rarely what anyone wants. |
| Save Generated Ledger As Draft | On, the generated accruals are left as drafts for review. Off, they are committed immediately. |
| Generated Rent Installment Ledger Book | The book the generated accruals are created in. |
| Generated Rent Installment Ledger Term | The term the generated accruals are created with — **this is where the accrual's own accounts live**, not on the contract term. |

That last point catches people out. The contract term decides *whether* and *when* accruals are
generated; the term named in *Generated Rent Installment Ledger Term* decides *which accounts they
hit*. The accrual ledger's own term is a rent-family term too, but a very short one: it shows only
the *Total contract effect* and *Tax Effects* pages, because an accrual has no deposit, no
commission and no water charge to book.

::: tip Worked example — a landlord term that accrues monthly
For the 3-year shop lease at 120,000 a year, a typical landlord configuration is:

- **Page 0**, income blocks pointing at rent revenue, advance income blocks pointing at deferred rent
  income, and *Split Installment Value If It Spans More Than Two Years* on so the September–November
  quarter is apportioned correctly.
- **Generate Rent Installment Ledger** on, **Rent Ledger Period Type** set to *Monthly*, *Save
  Generated Ledger As Draft* off, and a dedicated accrual book and accrual term named.
- The accrual term itself debits deferred rent income and credits rent revenue on its
  *Total contract effect* page.

Committing the lease now produces thirty-six monthly accrual documents, each releasing one month's
share out of deferred income into revenue. The contract booked 300,000 as deferred on day one; the
accruals give it back month by month.
:::

## Pages 1 to 5 — deposits, commissions, charges

Each of these pages holds one debit block and one credit block, and each books exactly one amount
from the lease's value block.

**Insurrance effect** books the tenant's security deposit. It is not income — it is money held on the
tenant's behalf — so the pair almost always credits a deposits-held liability. When the lease ends,
the termination document decides what comes back.

**Commissions effect** books the brokerage commission earned on the lease. One option sits on this
page:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| Rent Value Include Commission | Off, the generated schedule adds the commission as a separate line on top of the rent. On, the commission is treated as already inside the quoted rent and no extra line is produced. |

**Maintenance effect** books the maintenance charge carried on the lease, and **Water expense
effect** books the water and utility charge. Both are charges the tenant pays alongside the rent, and
both are optional — a lease that does not levy them leaves the pages empty.

**commission Collection Effect** is the page where you set the accounts for the commission charged on
collecting the rent — the fee a managing agency keeps out of what it collects for the landlord. Like
the other charge pages it holds one debit block and one credit block, and both must be filled for the
commission to be booked at all.

## Page 6 — the auto-cancel book and term

When a lease is renewed with **Extend Contract**, the renewal automatically cancels the lease it
replaces, and to do that it needs somewhere to put the generated termination document. That is the
whole content of this page:

| Field | What it does |
|---|---|
| Cancel Contract Book | The book the auto-generated lease-termination document is created in |
| Cancel Contract Term | The term it is created with |

Both are **mandatory whenever a contract uses auto-cancel**, and because Extend Contract always turns
auto-cancel on, in practice they are mandatory on any term used for renewable leases. Leave them
empty and the renewal fails to save with *"Please specify cancel contract book"* or *"Please specify
cancel contract term"*, with the error pointing back at the term field. See
[Renewing and Ending a Lease](/modules/realestate/rent/realestate-rent-renewal-and-termination).

## Page 7 — tax effects

| Field | What it does |
|---|---|
| Taxable | Copied onto the contract; decides whether tax rows are computed for the installments at all |
| Tax Plan | The tax plan the contract falls back on |
| Tax1 Debit / Tax1 Credit, Tax2 Debit / Tax2 Credit | The accounts the two taxes are booked to |

## The lease-termination term

Ending a lease early is a settlement, not a cancellation: several buckets of money flow back to the
tenant or stay with the landlord, and each of them belongs somewhere different. The termination
document therefore has a term all of its own, with **eight pages**, each owning one bucket:

| Page | Title on screen | The bucket |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Remaining inssurance effects · تاثيرات صافي التامين | The net deposit after everything has been deducted |
| 1 | Inssurance effects · تاثيرات التامين | The gross deposit |
| 2 | Commissions Effects · تأثيرات السعي | The unused portion of the commission |
| 3 | Water Expenses Effects · تأثيرات تكاليف المياه | The unused water charge |
| 4 | Maintenance Effects · تأثيرات تكاليف الصيانة | The unused maintenance charge |
| 5 | Discount value insurance effects · تاثيرات خصم التامين | The discount taken out of the deposit |
| 6 | Other discount effects · تاثيرات الخصومات الأخرى | Any other discount applied to the settlement |
| 7 | Remaining Effects · تاثيرات المتبقي | Everything still owed or prepaid at termination |

Pages 2, 3 and 4 each hold a debit block and a credit block for their bucket, and follow the same
both-halves-or-nothing rule as everywhere else: an unconfigured page means that bucket is not booked
and the tenant's settlement is simply shorter by that amount.

Page 7 is the largest. It holds the remaining-balance blocks plus four further account pairs that
separate what belongs to this year from what belongs to the next:

- Rent For Current Year Debit / Credit and Rent For Next Year Debit / Credit
- Expense For Current Year Debit / Credit and Expense For Next Year Debit / Credit

That split is what lets a tenant who leaves in September get this year's unearned rent treated
differently from rent he has already prepaid for next year.

Four behavioural options complete the term:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| Allow Cancel Of Rent Contract With Unpaid Installments | Off, a lease cannot be terminated while any installment is still unpaid. On, termination goes ahead and the arrears are carried by the *Remaining Effects* accounts — which is how most companies handle a tenant who leaves owing money. |
| Calculate Remaining Rent Values Based On System Paid Rent | Derives the current-year / next-year rent split from the amounts actually recorded as paid rather than from the contract schedule. |
| Delete Ldegers Saved As Draft After Saving Cancel Contract | Deletes the terminated lease's **draft** accrual documents when the termination is saved, so future accruals do not linger. Pairs with *Save Generated Ledger As Draft* on the contract term. *(The shipped label carries the typo "Ldegers".)* |
| ReCreate Ledgers After Deleting Cancel Contract | If the termination document is later deleted, regenerates the original lease's accrual documents so the schedule comes back intact. |

Worked through: a tenant on the 120,000-a-year shop lease leaves four months early. *Allow Cancel Of
Rent Contract With Unpaid Installments* is on, so the termination commits despite one outstanding
quarter. The gross deposit is booked on page 1, a 10% early-termination discount on page 5, the
unused commission on page 2, and the net refund on page 0. The outstanding quarter and the rent
already prepaid for next year land on page 7's current-year and next-year blocks.

## The two remaining rent terms

**The batch lease generator** — the document that opens forty shop leases in one run — has a single
page titled **Settings** carrying just two fields: the **book** and the **term** that the generated
rent contracts will be created with. Both are **mandatory**, and their pickers only offer books and
terms belonging to the rent contract, so you cannot point them at the wrong document type by accident.
All the real accounting configuration lives in the term you name here — the batch document itself
posts nothing. See [Generating the Rent Schedule](/modules/realestate/rent/realestate-rent-schedule).

**The opening lease term** is the ordinary rent contract term with one extra page, **Pre paid effects
· تأثيرات المدفوع مسبقا**, for rent that the tenant paid before the system went live. Everything else
— the eight pages above, the accrual generation block, the tax page — behaves exactly as it does on a
normal lease, which is the point: an opening lease is a normal lease with a historical start date.
See [Opening Rent Contracts](/modules/realestate/opening/realestate-opening-rent-contracts).
