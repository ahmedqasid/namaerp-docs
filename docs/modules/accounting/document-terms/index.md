# Accounting Document Terms

Every accounting document that posts takes its accounts from its **document term** (توجيه) — so when
a voucher lands on the wrong account, a cheque moves to an unexpected status, or a letter of
guarantee posts nothing, the answer is almost always on the term. The idea of a term, and how a
document chooses one, is explained on
[Document Terms (per-type processing rules)](/modules/accounting/support/accounting-document-terms).
The pages below are the option-by-option reference, grouped by document family.

Every option is cited by its **field id** — `termConfig.` followed by the field name, for example
`termConfig.impliedCollection` — so you can search for a setting whatever language the screen is in.
The term screen is reached from **Basic → Settings → Document Term**.

::: tip Two kinds of account side
Some pairs on these screens are a full account-side block, described in
[Anatomy of an Account Side](/modules/supplychain/document-terms/doc-term-accounting-effects#Anatomy-of-an-Account-Side);
others are a single reference to a saved
[Accounting Side Config](/platform/shared-master-files/accounting-side-config) record. Either way, on
most terms a pair posts only when both its debit and its credit are set, and a half-filled pair is
skipped without a message. The few exceptions are noted on their pages.
