# The In-System AI Assistant

Besides connecting external clients through the [MCP server](./ai-mcp-server.md), Nama ERP ships with a **built-in AI assistant** that works right inside the interface: a chat window the user opens to ask questions in natural language — Arabic or English — and the assistant answers from the system's actual data, runs reports, and even performs actions, using the same [AI tools](./ai-tool-definitions.md) the administrator defined and under the same permissions as the user sitting at the screen.

::: info Requirements
- The AI module installed and licensed.
- At least one chat model defined in [AI Module Configuration](./ai-configuration.md).
- At least one committed tool in the [AI Tool Definition](./ai-tool-definitions.md) screen (otherwise the assistant chats but cannot reach system data).

## Where to Find the Assistant

The AI assistant icon (**Nama AI Assistant**) is shown in the system's **top toolbar** and opens the chat window at any time. The assistant also appears:

- **Inside report screens**: open the chat while viewing a report, and the displayed report output becomes **context** the assistant can read and analyze — ask it to summarize the results or highlight the top values.
- **Inside record edit screens**: to discuss the record open in front of you.

## What Can the Assistant Do?

The assistant has no capability of its own — everything it does goes through a **tool** defined in the AI Tool Definition screen. So once you define query, report, entity-flow, and system tools, the assistant can:

- Answer questions from your data ("How many sales invoices this month?", "Who are the top five customers by balance?").
- Run a report with parameters it infers from your question, and read its output.
- Perform an action on a document through an entity flow (approve, post, ...).
- Read a record or import new records, if the import tools are enabled.
- Search the Nama ERP documentation, if the docs system tool is enabled.

In all cases the user's permissions and dimensions (legal entity, branch, ...) apply: the assistant only sees what the user sees, and only does what the user is allowed to do.

## Working With the Chat Window

### Choosing the Model

At the top of the window is a drop-down to choose the **chat model**, listing the models defined in [Module Configuration](./ai-configuration.md). You can switch models by task — a faster model for simple questions and a stronger one for complex analysis.

### Chat History

The system saves your conversations in **sessions** you can return to later. From the chat side panel:

- **New chat**: start a clean session with no prior context.
- **History**: browse your previous sessions to resume any of them.

Each user sees only their own sessions.

### Rating Answers (Like / Dislike)

Below each assistant reply are **Like** and **Dislike** buttons. Your rating is saved with the message and helps track answer quality and refine tool setup and descriptions over time.

### Expert Mode

In normal mode you see the conversation as a simple dialog (your question and the assistant's answer). **Expert Mode** reveals what happens behind the scenes and classifies every message:

| Message Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **User** | Your own message |
| **Assistant** | The language model's reply |
| **System** | The system instructions guiding the model |
| **Tool Execution Result** | The output of a tool the model called |

This mode is very useful for technical support and power users: it reveals **which tool the assistant called, with what parameters, and what it returned**, making it easy to diagnose an unexpected answer — is the problem in the tool's description? the query? the permissions?

### The Available Tools List

The side panel shows the tools available to the assistant in this session — the same committed, non-inactive tools this user is allowed to use in the AI Tool Definition screen. If a tool you expect is missing, it is most likely not committed, inactive, or prevented for the user by the access-control grid.

## When the Assistant Can't Find Something

Many tools take a **reference** (customer, item, ...). If the user sends an approximate name instead of the code, the assistant relies on **semantic search** to find the closest records — provided the entity type is indexed in [embedding configuration](./ai-configuration.md#Semantic-Search-and-Embedding-Setup). Without it the assistant still works with explicit codes, but it does not "guess" the reference from free text.

## The Assistant and the MCP Server

The in-system assistant and external MCP clients are **two faces of one base**: both use the same set of tools defined in the AI Tool Definition screen, with the same access check at execution time. The difference is that the in-system assistant runs inside the interface as the logged-in user, while an external client connects through API credentials as in the [MCP Server guide](./ai-mcp-server.md).
