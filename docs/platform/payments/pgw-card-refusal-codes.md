# PGW: Card Refusal Codes

When a card payment through PGW fails, the cashier needs to know one thing quickly: is this a card the customer can try again, or a card that will never go through? The card machine answers every declined payment with a response code. This page lists the codes and their meanings, so a cashier or support agent can turn a number on the screen or on the slip into a decision.

How the payment travels and where it can fail is described in [How a Card Payment Travels Through PGW](/platform/payments/pgw-card-payment-flow).

## Where to find the code

- **Geidea machines.** Nama shows the code and its meaning in the refusal message itself, for example *Purchase Transaction refused - 116 - Not Enough Balance*.
- **Neoleap machines.** Nama shows *Purchase Transaction refused* without a code. Open PGW's **Last Transactions** window. The machine's answer (the line that starts with *Here is the body of neoleap response*) contains the code in `TerminalStatusCode` and a short result in English, such as `DECLINED`.
- **InterPay.** softPOS returns the reason as text. It is in the `message` field of the answer in PGW's **Last Transactions** window.

## Geidea codes

These are the three-digit codes Nama recognises. Every code that starts with `9` means *Declined, System Error*.

| Code | Meaning shown | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 100, 102, 103, 105, 107, 108, 109, 110, 112, 114, 120, 122, 126, 128, 182, 183, 184, 185, 188, 190, 200, 202, 203, 205, 207 | *Declined* | The bank declined the card without giving a reason. Ask for another card or another way to pay. |
| 111, 118, 125, 129, 208, 209, 210 | *Declined, Contact your bank* | The customer has to settle it with their bank. Ask for another card. |
| 101, 201 | *Expired Card, Contact your bank* | Ask for another card. |
| 104 | *Restricted card, transaction not allowed* | Ask for another card. |
| 115, 204 | *Transaction not allowed* | The card cannot be used for this kind of purchase. Ask for another card. |
| 119 | *Transaction not permitted to cardholder* | Ask for another card. |
| 116 | *Not Enough Balance* | Ask for another card, or split the payment and take part of it in another way. |
| 121 | *Exceeds withdrawal amount limit* | The amount is over the card's limit. Split the payment or ask for another card. |
| 123 | *Declined, limits exceeded* | Same as 121. |
| 117 | *INVALID PIN* | Let the customer try again with the right PIN. |
| 127 | *Wrong PIN* | Same as 117. |

| 480, 481 | *Un successful* | Try the payment once more. If it fails again, take another way to pay. |
| 501 | *RECONCILIATION UNSUCCESSFUL* | The machine's own settlement with the acquirer failed. Contact Geidea support about the machine. |
| 888 | *Error* | Try once more. If it repeats, press **Test Connection** in PGW. |
| Any code starting with 9 | *Declined, System Error* | A problem at the bank or the card network. Try again after a short while, or take another way to pay. |

## Neoleap codes

These are the two-digit `TerminalStatusCode` values. `00` means the payment was approved.

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Completed – transaction declined for different reasons (including invalid PIN), account not debited. | Ask the customer to try again, or ask for another card. |
| 02 | Completed – transaction rejected, account not debited. | Ask for another card. |
| 11 | Cancelled by user, account not debited. | The customer or the cashier cancelled on the machine. Take the payment again if needed. |
| 12 | Void due to communication failure or some other reason, account not debited. | Check the machine's connection, then try again. |
| 13 | Card Not Supported | Ask for another card. |
| 14 | Transaction Not allowed | Ask for another card. |
| 15 | Expired Card | Ask for another card. |
| 16 | No Dial Tone (Phone line disconnected) | The machine has lost its own line to the bank. Check its network or SIM. |

| 90 | Card removed after PIN entry. | Try again and leave the card in until the machine says so. |
| 91 | Card removed Before PIN entry | Same as 90. |
| 92 | Card removed after sending request (ARQC check failed). | Same as 90. |
| 93 | Card Timeout. | Try again. |

| 98 | Transaction declined by Card | Ask for another card. |
| 99 | EMV Card not Detected by POS (Card not inserted into POS) | Insert or tap the card properly, then try again. |

A declined payment does not fill in the payment line, so there is nothing to undo in Nama.
