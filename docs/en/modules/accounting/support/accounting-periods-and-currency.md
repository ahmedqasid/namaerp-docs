# Fiscal Periods, Period Locking & Multi-Currency

Two questions sit underneath a lot of support tickets: "why won't this document save into this date?" and "why did a foreign-currency balance suddenly change?" Both come down to the same two machineries — how time is divided into **fiscal periods** that can be opened and locked, and how the system handles **more than one currency**. This page is the reference the per-page "For Support" sections point to.

## Fiscal years and periods

Accounting time is divided into a **Fiscal Year** (`Basic > Master Files > Fiscal Year`), and each year is split into **fiscal periods** (normally the twelve months, though the period structure is generated to suit the installation). Every document carries a **value date**, and from that date the system derives which **period** it falls into — that's the period stamped on its ledger effect and the one its figures roll up into.

This is why the value date matters so much: change it and you change which period (and which year) the document belongs to.

## Opening and locking periods

A period can be **open** (postings allowed) or **closed** (locked). You control this through **Fiscal Year Status Update** (`Basic > Master Files > Fiscal Year Status Update`), which opens or closes a **range** of periods at once — so after a month is reviewed and reported, you close it and nothing can change underneath the numbers you've already published.

For finer control than a whole period, **Prevent Transactions On Accounts Or Subsidiaries** (`Accounting > Master Files > Prevent Transactions On Accounts Or Subsidiaries`) locks postings on **specific accounts or subsidiaries** (optionally within a date range) — useful for freezing a single account while the rest of the period stays open. The year-end workflow that uses these is described in [Year-end closing & period control](../year-end-and-period-control.md).

## Working in more than one currency

Multi-currency rests on the **Ledger** (`دفتر حسابات`), which defines the **main currency** the books are kept in and a **reporting currency** for presentation. Every foreign-currency transaction is stored with both its **original value** and its **local value** at the day's rate, so balances can always be shown either way.

Rates move, though, and that creates **currency differences** on open foreign balances. Two documents handle this:

- **Exchange Rate Update** (`Accounting > Documents > Exchange Rate Update`) — revalues foreign-currency account balances at a new rate and posts the resulting gain/loss, so the local value of those balances reflects today's rate.
- **Currency Diff Journal** (`Accounting > Documents > Currency Diff Journal`) — records a currency-difference entry directly (see also [Journal entries & adjustments](../journal-entries.md), where currency-difference journals are covered).

Two account-level flags shape this behavior: one makes an account **keep its transaction's local currency** (rather than being revalued), and another **excludes the account from the automatic exchange-rate update** — so accounts that shouldn't be revalued (a fixed-rate settlement account, say) are left alone.

## For Support

- **"The document won't save into this date"** — its **period** is closed; reopen the range with **Fiscal Year Status Update**, or check **Prevent Transactions** locks on the account/subsidiary.
- **"A foreign balance's local value changed"** — an **Exchange Rate Update** revalued it at a new rate; that's expected, and the difference is the currency gain/loss.
- **"An account shouldn't be revalued but is (or vice-versa)"** — check its **keep transaction local currency** and **exclude from exchange-rate update** flags.
- **"The wrong period was stamped"** — it follows the document's **value date**; correct the date and reprocess (see [How documents are processed into accounting effects](./accounting-request-processing.md)).
