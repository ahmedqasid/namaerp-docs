## Introduction and Welcome
[00:00:01](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=1)  
In the name of God, peace be upon you. We continue today with a detailed explanation of the HR topic. In the previous video we discussed payroll items, performance indicators, and basic formulas — today we will continue in detail.

---

## Quick Review of What Was Covered in the Previous Video
[00:00:15](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=15)
- We discussed performance indicators and their types: system-generated, manual, the difference between them, and when to use each.
- We explained how to select a performance indicator and how to apply it — whether daily or quarterly.
- We clarified that repetition counts affect the calculation, but a delay of half an hour or an hour has a different impact.

---

## Performance Rate and How It Is Calculated
[00:01:38](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=98)
- The performance rate is how an absence day is deducted from the basic or gross salary.
- Is tax included or not? Are social insurance contributions present?
- The daily basic salary is calculated by dividing the monthly salary by the number of days in the month.
- Some companies use a fixed 30-day month; others use the actual working days excluding weekly holidays.
- There are classifications such as basic salary, housing allowance, transportation allowance, installments, end-of-service gratuity, etc.

---

## Classification Details and Basic Salary
[00:03:22](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=202)
- Classifications such as basic salary, daily rate, and final salary.
- Daily basic salary = monthly salary ÷ number of days in the month.
- The number of days in the month is configured from the HR system settings.
- The basic salary can apply to one or more payroll items depending on the design and requirements.

---

## Indicator Multipliers and Their Values
[00:04:58](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=298)
- Indicator multipliers are numbers multiplied by the indicator value, such as for absence or lateness.
- Example: one day of absence = 1 × daily basic salary.
- Lateness under a quarter hour or half an hour is handled with only a multiplier, without an indicator value.
- Overtime is calculated using extra working hours within defined brackets.
- The indicator value is used with the multiplier when ranges (defined time intervals) are involved.

---

## Repetition Counts and Their Effect on Calculation
[00:06:32](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=392)
- Repetition counts refer to the number of times an absence or lateness occurs within a defined period (month, 3 months, 6 months, or a year).
- HR systems allow accumulating periods such as every 3 months or every year to track repetitions.
- Example: if an employee is late twice in January and February, that counts as two repetitions in the accumulated period.
- Complex scenarios can be handled to adjust penalties or deductions in line with company policy.

---

## The Difference Between Repetition Counts and Range
[00:10:12](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=612)
- **Repetition Counts:** the number of times a specific indicator occurs in a time period — for example, the number of absent days.
- **Range:** a time interval or a defined quantity within which the indicator is calculated — for example, lateness from 15 to 40 minutes.
- Absence does not normally use a range because an employee is either present or absent (0 or 1).
- Lateness can use a range to determine the deduction amount based on how long the employee was late.
- The range can be configured based on work shifts, where working hours and acceptable lateness minutes differ.

---

## Using Queries to Configure the Range in the System
[00:12:26](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=746)
- Queries can be written inside the system to retrieve values associated with the range based on the employee's shift.
- Example: determining the number of working hours in the morning or night shift and returning the appropriate lateness time for each case.
- This allows flexibility in handling different work schedules.

---

## A Practical Example of Overtime with Time Brackets
[00:15:57](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=957)
- Example: the first hour is calculated with a multiplier of 2, the second hour with 1, the third with 1, and so on.
- If an employee works 3 overtime hours, the brackets must be applied correctly to ensure accurate calculation.
- Explanation of how using an open or closed range affects the calculation and how this can be adjusted using a negative added value to correct the results.

---

## The Concept of Added Value and How to Use It
[00:20:16](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=1216)
- Added value is used to adjust calculation results within formulas.
- Example: deduct a certain number of overtime hours then multiply the remainder by a specific multiplier.
- This allows distributing overtime across multiple brackets correctly.

---

## The Practical Difference Between Repetition Counts and Range in Lateness
[00:23:52](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=1432)
- Repetition counts track how many times an employee was late, regardless of how long each lateness was.
- The range calculates the duration of lateness each time, within a defined time period.
- Example: being late 25 minutes on 3 occasions means 3 repetition counts.
- Lateness over 30 minutes results in a half-day deduction on the first occurrence, as determined by the range.

---

## Examples of Lateness Applications with Repetition Counts and Range
[00:26:40](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=1600)
- Grace period for lateness: 10 minutes.
- From 10 to 30 minutes: a quarter-day deduction on the first occurrence, a half-day on the second.
- Lateness over half an hour: a half-day deduction on the first occurrence, a full day on subsequent occurrences.
- A practical application showing how deductions are calculated based on range and repetition rules.

---

## Summary of the Differences Between Repetition Counts and Range
[00:30:00](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=1800)
- Repetition counts move across days and count the number of times an indicator occurs.
- The range is calculated within a single day only — for example, the lateness on a specific day.
- The range does not accumulate daily, whereas repetition counts do accumulate.
- Therefore the appropriate method must be chosen depending on the type of indicator.

---

## Rounding in Time Calculation (Quarter Hour, Half Hour, Hour)
[00:35:27](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=2127)
- Time rounding helps calculate overtime or lateness to an acceptable level of precision.
- Example: if an employee is 55 minutes late, it is counted as 45 minutes (a quarter to the hour).
- If the employee is 37 minutes late, it is rounded down to 30 minutes.
- This helps simplify calculations and comply with company rules.

---

## Notes on Formulas and Salary Details
[00:39:02](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=2342)
- Displaying the regulation code and formula notes in salary details within the system.
- These notes help the reviewer trace how the salary and deductions were calculated.
- Reports can be generated showing the number of lateness and absence occurrences and their impact on the salary.

---

## Release Multipliers and Special Scenarios for Days Before Holidays
[00:40:44](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=2444)
- The ability to configure special multipliers for working days that precede official or weekly holidays.
- Example: Sunday before an official holiday can be calculated differently from other days of the week.
- This helps manage absence or lateness on specific days precisely.

---

## Applying Criteria to Different Employee Files
[00:44:50](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=2690)
- Some criteria apply only to specific employees based on data in the employee file or the personnel affairs file.
- Flexibility in system queries to fetch information from multiple sources.
- This allows regulations and policies to be applied accurately across different categories of employees.

---

## Taxes and How They Are Calculated in the System
[00:48:44](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=2924)
- Taxes are calculated on the total monthly payroll items, not only on the basic salary.
- Some companies separate payroll items where the employee bears the tax from those borne by the company.
- Tax brackets are calculated monthly and annually in accordance with local law.
- The ability to perform year-end tax reconciliations to adjust differences.

---

## Detailed Explanation of Tax Brackets and Salary Payouts
[00:54:30](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=3270)
- Payouts may be disbursed in multiple instalments within the month (basic salary, overtime, incentives, allowances, etc.).
- Taxes are calculated on each payout separately or in aggregate depending on the system configuration.
- Definition of three types of payouts: basic, overtime, and incentives.
- Specific payouts can be designated to have particular formulas applied to them.

---

## Payroll Periods and the Possibility of Distributing Salaries Across Two Periods
[00:59:30](https://youtu.be/2GHsOiQPBRU?t=3570)
- The ability to have more than one payroll period in the same year (for example, first half and second half of the year).
- It is not possible to issue salaries for more than one payroll period in the same month.
- Payouts can be linked to different payroll periods.

---
