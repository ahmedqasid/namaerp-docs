# EASubmitEltezamData

## Overview

Sends Eltezam data to the MCS server from a task schedule. Given the codes of committed MCS Eltezam Submission documents, it sends each of them exactly as the post-commit flow [EASendEltezamSubmissionDoc](EASendEltezamSubmissionDoc.md) would. Given no documents, it sends the employees of the Eltezam Configuration's employee group directly, with no submission document involved. See [Eltezam Submissions and Sending](/modules/integrations/eltezam/eltezam-submissions-and-sending).

## When This Action Runs

From a Task Schedule of type **Action**, for sending at night or re-sending on demand. Two runs cannot overlap.

## How It Works

1. **Checks the parameters** - The server is required. If a configuration code is given but no configuration has it, the run fails. Any HR Period or HR Year code given must exist.
2. **With document codes** (parameter 3):
   - Finds each listed submission. A code that is not found, or a submission that is still a draft, fails the run before anything is sent.
   - For each submission, uses the configuration from parameter 1 instead of the document's when one is given, combines the period parameters with the document's own period (each filled parameter wins), then clears the document's previous request log and sends its employee lines. The document's grid, counts and request log are updated.
3. **Without document codes** - Sends every employee of the configuration's employee group, for every operation enabled on the configuration, for the period in parameters 4 to 7 (the whole history when all four are empty). The request log entries are linked to the task schedule, not to a submission document, so no document shows their results.
4. **Stops if the server is down** - After three technical failures in a row it stops sending and reports that it stopped.

## Parameters

**Parameter 1:** Eltezam Configuration Code (Can be Empty when documents are given) - The configuration to send with. Required when parameter 3 is empty.

**Parameter 2:** MCS Server (IP, host or full URL) (Required) - Where to send. A full URL is used as it is; a bare host or IP keeps the scheme and path of the configuration's Service URL and replaces only the host.

**Parameter 3:** Eltezam Submission Document Codes (Comma Separated, Can be Empty) - The committed submissions to send, for example `EZS-0012, EZS-0013`.

**Parameter 4:** From Date (yyyy-MM-dd, Can be Empty) - Start of the period, for example `2026-01-01`.

**Parameter 5:** To Date (yyyy-MM-dd, Can be Empty) - End of the period.

**Parameter 6:** HR Period Code (Can be Empty) - The HR Period to send.

**Parameter 7:** HR Year Code (Can be Empty) - The HR Year to send. When From Date or To Date is empty, the HR Year's start or end date takes its place.

## Important Notes

- Use submission documents whenever you want to review what was sent; the group mode leaves no document showing the results.
- In the task schedule's **Class Name**, write the full class name below; the short name alone is not found.
