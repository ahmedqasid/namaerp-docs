# Omniful Integration Guide

## Overview

Nama ERP integrates with [Omniful](https://www.omniful.ai/), a unified supply chain platform that provides comprehensive warehouse management and order fulfillment capabilities. This integration enables seamless data synchronization between Nama ERP and Omniful for inventory management, order processing, and supply chain operations.

## Integration Architecture

The integration operates in two directions:

1. **Outbound (Nama ERP → Omniful)**: Master data and transactions are sent from Nama ERP to Omniful using Entity Flows
2. **Inbound (Omniful → Nama ERP)**: Orders, stock transfers, purchase orders, and receipts are received from Omniful via webhooks

## Configuration Setup

### 1. Omniful Configuration Entity

Navigate to **Magento → Omniful Configuration** to create and configure the integration settings.

#### Required Fields

| Field | Arabic Name | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| User Name | - | Omniful API username |
| Password | - | Omniful API password |
| Seller Code | اسم البائع | Unique seller identifier in Omniful |
| Webhook Secret Key | - | Secret key for webhook authentication |
| Tenant API Username | المستخدم | Tenant API username for advanced operations |
| Tenant API Password | كلمة المرور | Tenant API password |
| Nama API Key | - | API credentials for Nama ERP access |

#### Reference Field Configuration

These fields map Omniful IDs to specific fields in Nama ERP entities:

| Field | Arabic Name | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Omniful Reference Field For Orders | حقل مرجع أومنيفل في الطلبات | Maps sales orders to Omniful order IDs |

| Omniful Reference Field For Stock Receipt | حقل مرجع أومنيفل في التوريد المخزني | Maps stock receipts |

### 2. Document Generation Configuration

For each document type that will be received from Omniful, configure the Document Generation Info Lines:

#### Supported Document Types

- **Sales Order** (`SalesOrder`)
- **Issue Stock Transfer** (`IssueStockTransfer`)
- **Receipt Stock Transfer** (`ReceiptStockTransfer`)
- **Stock Transfer Request** (`StockTransferReq`)
- **Purchase Order** (`PurchaseOrder`)
- **Stock Receipt** (`StockReceipt`)

#### Configuration Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Entity Type | Select the document type from the dropdown |
| Apply When Query | Optional query to conditionally apply this configuration |
| Book | Document book to assign to generated documents |
| Term | Document term to assign to generated documents |
| Save Doc With Errors As Draft | If enabled, documents with validation errors will be saved as drafts instead of failing |

::: warning Important
- At least one configuration line must be defined for the integration to work
- Either Webhook Secret Key or Nama API Key must be configured
- All reference fields are required and must point to valid custom fields in the respective entities

## Outbound Data Synchronization (Nama ERP → Omniful)

Data goes to Omniful through actions that run on the record being sent. Add the action to an
[entity flow](/platform/entity-flows/introduction-to-entity-flows) on the matching screen, and put its
**full name** in the **Class Name** column of a detail line: `com.namasoft.modules.magento.utils.omniful.`
followed by the short name, for example `com.namasoft.modules.magento.utils.omniful.EASendCustomerToOmniful`.
The short name on its own is not found — type the short name and pick the full name from the
suggestion list. Parameters are plain text. **Parameter 1** is always the code (or ID) of the Omniful
Configuration record, and a parameter that names a field takes the field's ID.

### Which action sends what

| Action | Runs on | Arrives in Omniful as | Parameter 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EASendCustomerToOmniful` | Customer | Customer | Field that holds the customer's Omniful ID (required) |
| `EASendSupplierToOmniful` | Supplier | Supplier | — |
| `EASendItemToOmniful` | Item | One SKU per Sizes and Colors line | Yes/no field — ticked means update (required) |
| `EASendWarehouseToOmniful` | Warehouse | Hub | Yes/no field — ticked means update (required) |
| `EASendSalesInvoiceToOmniful` | Sales Invoice | Sales order | Field that holds the Omniful order ID (required) |
| `EASendSalesQuotationToOmniful` | Sales Quotation | Sales order | Field that receives the Omniful order ID (required) |
| `EASendReturnInvoiceToOmniful` | Sales Return | Return on the original order | Field that points to the document the order was sent from (required) |
| `EASendPurchaseOrderToOmniful` | Purchase Order | Purchase order | — |
| `EASendStockTransferReqToOmniful` | Stock Transfer Request | Stock transfer order (STO) | Yes/no field — ticked means update (required) |
| `EASendStockTransferReqAsPurchaseOrderToOmniful` | Stock Transfer Request | Purchase order into the destination hub | Field that holds the supplier (optional) |
| `EASendIssueStockTransferToOmniful` | Issue Stock Transfer | Purchase order into the receiving hub | Field that holds the supplier (optional) |

### Create or update — how each action decides

- **By an ID field.** Customer, Sales Invoice and Sales Quotation are created in Omniful while the
  field in parameter 2 is empty, and the ID Omniful returns is written into that field. For the
  Customer and the Sales Invoice, a filled field makes the next run send an update.
- **By a yes/no field.** Item, Warehouse and Stock Transfer Request (as STO) send an update when the
  yes/no field in parameter 2 is ticked, otherwise a create. Use a flag that becomes ticked once the
  record has been sent, such as a "committed before" field.
- **By the configuration's reference field.** Purchase Order, Stock Transfer Request (as purchase
  order) and Issue Stock Transfer read the reference field set on the Omniful Configuration —
  **Omniful Reference Field For Purchase Order**, **Omniful Reference Field For Stock Transfer
  Request** and **Omniful Reference Field For Issue Stock Transfer**. An empty field means create, and
  the Omniful purchase order ID that comes back is written into it.
- Supplier always creates, and Sales Return always sends a new return.

### What each action sends

- **Customer** — Arabic name as first name, English name as last name, email, mobile, Telephone 1 as
  the alternate number, gender, birth date, the contact address (the country defaults to Saudi Arabia
  when the address has none) and the passport, if there is one.
- **Supplier** — code, name, email and mobile.
- **Item** — every line of the item's **Sizes and Colors** grid becomes one SKU, whose code is used as
  both the SKU code and its barcode. An item with no Sizes and Colors lines sends nothing. The SKU is
  *live* unless the item is marked Prevent Usage. New SKUs go 50 at a time.
- **Warehouse** — the warehouse code becomes the Omniful hub code. Every document later finds its hub
  by that code, so keep the two the same.
- **Sales Invoice / Sales Quotation** — the document code as the order alias, the warehouse as the
  hub, the customer, billing and shipping addresses, the lines (price, discount, tax, net), the totals
  and the first payment line's method. The quotation's code matters on the way back: an order Omniful
  later sends with that code as its alias is linked to the quotation.
- **Sales Return** — each line's item, quantity, price, discount and net value, with the line remarks
  as the return reason.
- **Purchase Order** — the supplier, the warehouse as hub, the lines with their unit price, the
  remarks and the currency.
- **Stock Transfer Request (as STO)** — the lines, the warehouse as the source hub and the To
  Warehouse as the destination hub.
- **Stock Transfer Request / Issue Stock Transfer (as purchase order)** — the lines and the supplier
  from parameter 2, received into the To Warehouse (request) or the Send To Warehouse (issue transfer).

Quantities are always sent in the item's base unit, as whole numbers.

## Inbound Data Synchronization (Omniful → Nama ERP)

#### Webhook Endpoint

Configure Omniful to send webhooks to your Nama ERP webhook endpoint with the following events:

#### Supported Events

1. **Order Events**
   - `order.*` with `type: "sto"` → Creates Stock Transfer Requests or Issue Stock Transfers
   - `order.*` (non-STO) → Creates Sales Orders

2. **Purchase Events**
   - `purchase.*` → Creates Purchase Orders

3. **GRN Events**
   - `grn.*` → Creates Stock Receipts or Receipt Stock Transfers

### Document Creation Logic

#### Sales Orders
- Created when receiving `order` events (non-STO type) with status ≠ "new_order"
- Maps customer information, billing/shipping addresses, and order items
- Links to existing Sales Quotations if `order_alias` is provided

#### Stock Transfer Operations
- **Stock Transfer Request**: Created for STO orders with status "new_order"
- **Issue Stock Transfer**: Created for STO orders with status ≠ "new_order"
- **Receipt Stock Transfer**: Created from GRN events when matching Issue Stock Transfer exists

#### Purchase Orders
- Created from `purchase` events
- Includes supplier information, warehouse details, and purchase items

#### Stock Receipts
- Created from GRN events when no matching Issue Stock Transfer exists
- Links to existing Purchase Orders via `entity_id` reference

### Webhook Payload Processing

The webhook handler:
1. Validates the webhook secret key against the configuration
2. Parses the JSON payload to extract event type and data
3. Routes the event to the appropriate document creation method
4. Maps Omniful data to Nama ERP entities
5. Saves documents according to the Document Generation Info configuration
6. Updates reference fields with Omniful IDs for future synchronization

## Reading Orders From Omniful On Demand

The webhook is the normal way orders arrive. Three actions pull orders from Omniful instead — for
orders the webhook missed (for example while the ERP was down), for a past period, or to refresh one
order. All three save an order exactly as the order webhook would: the configuration's accepted
statuses, document generation lines (book and term), customer, warehouse, lines and addresses all
apply, and a Sales Order already holding the same Omniful order ID is updated rather than duplicated.
Each order is saved on its own, so one bad order does not undo the others.

They follow the same full-name rule as the sending actions, and parameter 1 is again the Omniful
Configuration's code or ID. The run stops if that configuration is not found or its **Omniful
Reference Field For Orders** is empty.

| Action | Use it to | Run it from |
|---|---|---|
| `EAReadOmnifulOrders` | Pull every order in a status and date range | A Task Schedule — on a schedule as a safety net, or with **Run Now** |
| `EAReadOmnifulOrdersByIds` | Pull particular orders by their sales channel order numbers | A Task Schedule with **Run Now** |
| `EAReReadOmnifulOrder` | Refresh the order behind the record the flow runs on | An entity flow on the Sales Order |

**`EAReadOmnifulOrders`** parameters:

| # | Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Order Status | An Omniful order status, passed to Omniful as is. Empty reads every status. |
| 3 | Created From (yyyy-MM-dd) | Only orders created on or after this date, for example `2026-10-01`. |
| 4 | Created To (yyyy-MM-dd) | Only orders created up to this date. |
| 5 | Allow Update (true/false) | `true` re-reads and updates orders already in Nama. Empty or `false` reads only the new ones. |

It asks Omniful for 100 orders at a time, page after page, until a page comes back with fewer.

**`EAReadOmnifulOrdersByIds`** parameters:

| # | Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Sales Channel Order IDs (CSV) | The order numbers as the sales channel knows them, separated by commas, for example `100045, 100046`. Required — empty fails with "No order IDs provided". |
| 3 | Allow Update (true/false) | As above. |

An order number Omniful does not know is counted as failed. Both actions end with the warning
"Saved N order(s), M failed. Failed order aliases: ..." naming the orders that could not be read.

**`EAReReadOmnifulOrder`** takes the Omniful order ID from the record it runs on. Parameter 2 is the
ID of the field that holds it — on a Sales Order, the same field that is set as **Omniful Reference
Field For Orders**. An empty parameter or field fails the run ("No order ID field provided" / "No
order ID provided"). There is no "already in Nama" check: the order is always read again.

## Data Mapping

### Customer Data Mapping

| Nama ERP Field | Omniful Field |
|----------------|---------------|
| Name1 | first_name |
| Name2 | last_name |
| Contact Info → Email | email |
| Contact Info → Mobile | mobile |
| Gender | gender |
| Birth Date | date_of_birth |
| Contact Info → Address | address object |
| Passport Details | documents array |

### Item Data Mapping

| Nama ERP Field | Omniful Field |
|----------------|---------------|
| Size/Color Code | sku_code |
| Item Name | name |
| Code + Color | description |
| Prevent Usage | status ("live"/"un_sync") |
| Base UOM | uom |
| Net Purchase Value | cost |
| Current Price | selling_price, retail_price |

### Order Data Mapping

| Nama ERP Field | Omniful Field |
|----------------|---------------|
| ID | order_id |
| Code | order_alias |
| Warehouse Code | hub_code |
| Customer ID | customer.id |
| Billing Address | billing_address |
| Shipping Address | shipping_address |
| Order Items | order_items array |
| Payment Method | payment_method |

## Error Handling

### Document Creation Errors

When webhook processing encounters errors:

1. **Save as Draft**: If "Save Doc With Errors As Draft" is enabled in the configuration, the document is saved as a draft
2. **Exception Throwing**: If draft saving is disabled, the process throws an exception and returns an error response

### Validation Requirements

Before processing, the system validates:
- Omniful Configuration exists and is properly configured
- Document Generation Info Lines are defined
- Required reference fields are configured
- Webhook secret key matches the configuration

## API Clients

The integration uses two API client types:

### OmnifulSalesChannelAPIClient
- Used for customer and order-related operations
- Handles sales channel API endpoints
- Manages customer creation and updates

### OmnifulTenantAPIClient
- Used for warehouse management and inventory operations
- Handles tenant-level API endpoints
- Manages items, warehouses, and supply chain operations
