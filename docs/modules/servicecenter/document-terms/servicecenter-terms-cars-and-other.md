# Car, Insurance and Rental Document Terms

Nothing about a car's behaviour in Nama is built in. A chassis becomes a tracked record, moves
through a lifecycle, picks up a sales invoice reference and finally leaves the stock — and every one
of those steps happens because somebody switched it on in a **document term**. This page is the map
of those switches, for the showroom, the insurance desk, the rental counter and the courier round.

`srvcenter-subitems` for the car documents, `srvcenter-insurance-and-installments` for the policy
documents, `srvcenter-rental-assets` for the rental documents and `srvcenter-mobile-delivery` for the
courier documents.
:::

::: tip "Sub Item" means the car
The option labels on these term screens all say **Sub Item** / **الصنف الفرعي**, while the menu calls
the same object **Customer Car** / **السيارة**. They are one thing: the individually tracked [vehicle
record](/modules/servicecenter/cars-setup/car-master-file.md). This block of options is also shared with document terms outside Service Center, so you will
meet the identical labels on other modules' screens.
:::

## The Sub Item block — where car records come from

This block appears on the **Sub Item** tab of every car sales and car purchase term. It is the
biggest single block of configuration in the module, and it does two distinct jobs: it **creates**
car records, and it **stamps** them.

### Creating the car record

**Create Sub Item From Line Information** / **إنشاء صنف فرعي من السطر** is the master switch. With it
on, saving the document creates a car record from each line's data — chassis, engine, colour, key
number, price. It also enables the matching *Create Sub Item From Line Information* button in the
document's More menu.

> A car record is created automatically when you save **any** Car Purchases document — order,
> receipt, pro-forma, purchase invoice or purchase return — whose term has *Create Sub Item From
> Line Information* switched on. Switch it on for exactly one document type in your chain.

Al-Sahra Motors switched it on for the **Car Purchase Invoice** term only, so `SIPI-2026-021` on
10 February 2026 is where six `CAR-…` records were born, each starting at status *Pre Initial*.

::: danger Two documents with the switch on will not warn you
If the flag is on for two documents in the same chain, what happens depends on how the second
document was built.

- Built **from** the first — the line carries the car reference forward, so the existing record is
  found and **re-edited**. No duplicate, but its group, default status and warehouse are silently
  rewritten, even on a car already in use.
- Lines typed **fresh** — a second, duplicate car record is created with a new code. Nothing checks
  the chassis number; there is no uniqueness rule on it anywhere.

Never switch it on for a **return** term. A purchase return or a sales return with the flag on will
mint brand-new car records for cars that are going away.
:::

::: warning Splitting a quantity works only on copied documents
**Spread Sub Item Lines If Qty Greater Than One** splits a line for six cars into six lines of one,
so each gets its own record — but only when the document was built from another document. Type a
line with quantity 6 by hand on a Car Purchase Invoice and it stays one line, producing **one** car
record for six cars. When entering a purchase by hand, type one line per chassis, as Al-Sahra's
six-line invoice does.
:::

**Sub Item Status Value Date Field Id** decides which of the document's dates orders the car's status
history. Because the status is replayed in date order rather than simply overwritten, this choice
matters for back-dated documents.

### Stamping the car record

A long family of *Update … In Sub Item* switches, each of which writes one back-reference onto the
car's **Statistics** tab when the document commits: the purchase order, the purchase invoice, the
stock receipt, the sales quotation and quotation request, the sales order, the sales invoice, the
traffic letter and letter request, the salesperson, the cancelling document and the delivery date.
Cancelling the document clears its own stamp again, provided the car still points at it.

Alongside them:

- **Copy Warehouse To Sub Item** / **Copy Locator To Sub Item** — writes the line's warehouse and
  locator onto the car, which is how a car "knows" it is in `WH-SHOW`.
- **Update Branch / Sector / Department / Analysis Set In Sub Item From Invoice** (or *From
  Warehouse*) — copies dimensions onto the car record.
- **Copy Tax 1–4 Percentage From / To Sub Item** and **Copy Taxes From Sub Item After** — keeps
  per-car tax rates and the line's tax rates in step.

::: warning What the Final Delivery does not stamp
Even with the whole stamping block switched on, a committed [Final Delivery](/modules/servicecenter/car-sales/car-final-delivery.md) leaves the car's
*Delivery Status*, *Delivered To Customer*, *Plate Number* and every registration and customs field
**empty**. Only *Delivery Date* is written, and only when *Update Delivery Date In Sub Item* is on.
Al-Sahra types plate `ر ط ص 8318` onto `CAR-000318` by hand on 5 March, after the plates come back.
There is no term option that changes this.
:::

## The From Doc tab

Two options, and the first is the one that keeps a document chain honest:

**Do Not Filter Sub Items By From Document Sub Items** — normally, a document built from another can
only name cars that were on the source. Switch this on and that restriction disappears. Leaving it
**off** is what stops a delivery naming a chassis that was never invoiced.

**Do Not Spread Line Data When Sub Item Of From Document Added** — suppresses the automatic copying
of line data when a car is pulled from the source document.

## The Reservation tab

**Reserve** (حجز), optionally guarded by **Reserve Only When Criteria Is Matched**, is the *only*
switch that makes an order-class car document touch quantities at all — and only as a reservation,
never as a stock movement. Al-Sahra's sales order `SISO-2026-0233` reserves chassis
`NWA7R24C26K000318`; it moves nothing.

The tab also carries *Check Available Quantities*, the warehouse and locator sources for the
reservation, *Cancel Reservation Of Related Docs* and *Prevent Cancel Reservation*.

## The Generation tab — the two settings that decide everything

**Generation Book** and **Generation Term** name the book and term of the stock document this
document creates. On the car documents, these two fields — and nothing else — decide whether stock
moves.

::: warning "Generate Document" and "Manual Generation" are ignored here
On the **Car Receipt** and the **Car Final Delivery**, the *Generate Document* and *Manual
Generation* tick boxes sitting right beside the book and term are not read at all. Unticking
*Generate Document* while leaving the book filled still produces the stock document. To stop
generation you must **clear the generation book and the generation term**.

The Car **Sales Invoice** is the exception: it does honour *Generate Document*.
:::

That asymmetry is exactly why the next two boxes matter.

::: danger Stock in — configure generation on exactly one term
The [**Car Receipt**](/modules/servicecenter/car-purchasing/car-receipt.md) and the [**Car Purchase Invoice**](/modules/servicecenter/car-purchasing/car-purchase-invoice.md) can each generate a Stock Receipt for the same
chassis, and neither can see the other's stock document. Configure both and the car is received
**twice**, at double cost, silently.

**Fill the generation Book and Term on exactly one of the two terms.** Al-Sahra generates on the
purchase invoice — `SIPI-2026-021` produced stock receipt `STR-2026-0552` into `WH-SHOW` — and leaves
the car receipt's generation book and term **empty**, so `SIR-2026-0088` records the physical
arrival, the accessory checklist and the parking slots and moves nothing. Remember that unticking
*Generate Document* on the receipt is **not** enough: blank the book and the term.

If instead you generate on the receipt, leave *Generate Document* off on the purchase invoice term
and use its *تجميع / Collect* and *تطبيق / Apply* buttons to link the receipts that already exist. On
whichever term does generate, switch **Do Not Generate Documents If Manual Documents Found** on as a
second line of defence.

Treat the receipt and the purchase invoice as **alternatives**, never as a sequence.
:::

::: danger Stock out — configure generation on exactly one term
The mirror image: the [**Car Sales Invoice**](/modules/servicecenter/car-sales/car-sales-invoice.md) and the **Car Final Delivery** can each generate a Stock
Issue for the same chassis, and neither sees the other's document. Configure both and the car leaves
stock twice, its cost is relieved to cost of sales twice and on-hand goes negative — either silently
or with a shortage error naming a stock document nobody created by hand.

**Fill the generation Book and Term on exactly one of the two terms.** Al-Sahra issues from the sales
invoice — `SISI-2026-0498` produced stock issue `STI-2026-1201` — and leaves the final delivery's
generation book and term **empty**, so `SIFD-2026-0357` is purely the hand-over record. Unticking
*Generate Document* on the final delivery does nothing; blank the book and the term.

The invoice and the final delivery are **alternatives** for stock purposes, not a sequence.
:::

## Which car documents actually post

The car sales term screen carries the full accounting block — debit and credit, cash, invoice and
line discount, seven further discount accounts, approximation discount, the tax accounts, service-fee
pairs, and for the sales order a pair of reservation-value accounts. It carries that block for
**every** document in the family, because the screen is assembled from one shared layout.

Only three of the fourteen ever post:

| Document | Posts? |
|---|---|
| Sales Order | **Yes** — this is where Al-Sahra's 5,000 booking deposit lands, against the reservation-value accounts |
| Sales Approval | **Yes** |
| Pro-forma Sales Invoice | **Yes** |
| Everything else in the family | **No** |

::: warning Accounts configured on the inert documents are silently ignored
Allocation, Allocation Cancel, Sales Order Cancel, Final Delivery, Final Delivery Cancel, Sales
Quotation, Sales Quotation Request, Car Receipt, Car Receipt Cancel and **all four traffic-letter
documents** show a complete Debit / Credit / Cash / Tax / Discount screen and never produce a journal
entry from it. There is no error and no warning — the entry simply never appears.

The traffic letters are the case support sees most often. `SITLR-2026-0288` and `SITL-2026-0296`
push chassis, engine and key data onto `CAR-000318` and move its status; they post nothing, and no
term option makes them post. Leave their account fields empty so nobody is misled later.
:::

::: danger The Car Pro-forma Purchase Invoice posts nothing on commit — but can post later
On the purchasing side, the **Car Pro-forma Purchase Invoice** has a complete accounting-effects page
on its term and produces **no entry when you commit it**. Worse, the generic **More → Regenerate
Accounting Effects** action on the same document *does* reach the ledger and creates entries from
those accounts. A document that has never posted can acquire a journal entry out of band, long after
the fact.

Document the pro-forma as a non-financial document and leave its account fields empty.
:::

The genuinely financial car documents are the **Car Purchase Invoice**, the **Car Purchase Return**,
the **Car Sales Invoice** and the **Car Sales Return** — those post from their term's accounts every
time, unconditionally.

## Purchase-side extras

The Car Purchase Invoice term carries the landed-cost machinery, which is what turns Al-Sahra's
74,000 list price into a 76,500 cost per car:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| Create Receipt Additional Cost With Service Items | Builds a receipt-additional-cost document from the invoice's service lines — the 9,000 freight, 4,200 clearance and 1,800 transport on `SIPI-2026-021` |
| Additional Cost Doc Book / Term | The book and term of that document — `RAC-2026-009` |
| Distribute Cost Based On Receipt Qty | Spreads the 15,000 by received quantity: 2,500 per car across six cars |
| Use From Doc Value Date For Receipt | Dates the generated stock receipt from the source document |
| Quantity Of Invoice Should Match Stock Document | Refuses an invoice whose quantities disagree with the receipts it collected |

The **Sub Item Assembly Document**, reached from Cars > Car Purchases, has the smallest term in the
whole car family: the standard Sub Item block described above, plus exactly two options — an
**Assembly Document Book** and an **Assembly Document Term**. Fill both and committing the document
creates the vehicle records *and* a matching supply-chain assembly document that consumes the chassis
item and the engine item named on the assembly bill of materials. Leave either empty and it stops
after creating the vehicle records. Note that this is the one document in the module gated by a
supply-chain licence code, `supplychain-assembly`, on top of `srvcenter-subitems`.

The Car Purchase Return term mirrors it with its own generation settings for the Stock Issue, plus
*Source Invoice Calculation*, *Recreate Inventory Stock Document With Return Invoice*, *Add Return To
Invoice Payment* and a difference debit/credit pair. The Car Purchase Order term is the plainest of
the four: taxable, tax plan, modifiable tax, *Disable After Use* and approximation discount.

## Insurance terms

The insurance sub-module's terms are small, and most of its documents have none at all.

**Insurance Policy Order** and **Insurance Policy Renewal** share one term, whose whole content is
one pair of accounting sides: *Insurance Value Debit* / *Insurance Value Credit* (مدين/دائن قيمة
التأمين). Al-Sahra's policy order `SIIPO-2026-0212` posts the typed 3,150 against that pair.

**Insurance Policy Receipt** gets the same pair. Its term also shows *Prevent Saving If Policy Is
Unpaid* (منع حفظ إذا كانت الوثيقة غير مسددة).

::: warning "Prevent Saving If Policy Is Unpaid" never fires
The check reads its setting from an empty configuration rather than from your term, so it can never
refuse anything. Ticking it changes nothing. If unpaid policies must not be received, enforce that
by procedure, not by this switch.
:::

[**Insurance Purchase Invoice**](/modules/servicecenter/car-insurance/car-insurance-purchase-invoice.md) — the dealer's settlement with the insurer — has three independent
account pairs, one per money column on the document: *Insurance Value*, *Insurance Commission*
(عمولة التأمين) and *Purchase Value* (قيمة الشراء). They post separately and are not required to add
up to anything: Al-Sahra's `SIIPI-2026-0074` posts 2,835, 315 and 3,150 against three different
pairs.

::: warning Only two of the three pairs are on the term screen
The standard term screen shows the **Insurance Value** debit and credit pair **twice** — once under
each of two groups — and does not show the **Purchase Value** pair at all. But the purchase-value
amount, the 3,150 on `SIIPI-2026-0074`, is posted against that missing pair.

The practical consequence: you cannot set the accounts for the purchase-value posting from this
screen, so that third posting cannot be configured without a screen modification. Take it up with
your implementation team before promising the insurer settlement will post in full.
:::

And the five documents with **no term at all** — Customer Insurance Policy, Policy Delivery, Policy
Cancellation, Policy Period Adjustment, Policy Value Adjustment — have nothing to configure and post
nothing. Their book's *توجيه* tab is empty by design.

## Rental terms

**Rental Request** and **Rental Invoice** — the [rental documents](/modules/servicecenter/rental-assets/servicecenter-rental-overview.md) — share a single term, carrying the full sales-invoice
account block: debit and credit sides, cash, invoice and line discount, the seven extra discount
accounts, approximation discount, the tax accounts and the service-fee pairs.

The rule to remember is that both documents post through the same engine, and **only when the debit
or the credit side is filled**. Leave the pair empty and neither the request nor the invoice produces
an entry. Al-Sahra bills the 520 for Fahad's twelve-hour courtesy car on `RARI-2026-0061` through
these accounts.

Because the two share one term record, a change made for the invoice applies to the request as well.
If you want the request to hold a booking without posting anything, give the request its own term
with the accounts left empty.

**Reservation Cancel** has its own small term with one pair: *Cancel Discount Value Debit* / *Cancel
Discount Value Credit*. The cancellation charge — a figure typed by hand on the document, say 100 —
posts as one debit and one credit against that pair. If either side is unset, nothing posts at all,
and no receivable is raised against the customer in any case.

## Courier terms

The [**Delivery Document**](/modules/servicecenter/mobile-delivery/servicecenter-mobile-delivery-documents.md) term names the packaging side of a courier round: *From Warehouse* and
*From Locator*, up to seven *Transfer Item* slots for the packaging items being tracked, and the
*Stock Transfer Book* and *Stock Transfer Term* of the transfer that moves them onto the courier.

The **Batch Delivery Document** term names what the batch generator produces: the *Delivery Document
Book* and *Delivery Document Term* for the sheets it creates, a *Collected Invoice Term* that
restricts which sales invoices are collected, and a row of *Consider … When Collect Lines* switches —
branch, sector, department, analysis set, courier, region, deliver-to and salesperson — that decide
how the collected invoices are grouped into rounds.

The **Invoice Receipt Document** term names two generated documents and one classification rule:
*Sales Return Book* and *Sales Return Term* for the credit raised against a short delivery (empty
means the shortfall is recorded but never credited), *Stock Transfer Book* and *Stock Transfer Term*
for the returned packaging, and an *Item Class* / *Package Type* pair that says which item
classification marks an item as packaging and which of the seven header counters it totals into.
