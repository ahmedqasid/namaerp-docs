## Overview

This entity flow recalculates and updates installment payment tracking for documents that support installment-based payments. It synchronizes the paid amounts and remaining balances based on actual payment records, ensuring accurate financial tracking for documents with payment installments.

## When This Action Runs

- **Trigger:** Manual execution or automated through entity flows for installment recalculation
- **Target:** Documents that support installment payments (invoices, contracts, loans)
- **Purpose:** Recalculate paid amounts and remaining balances for installment-based documents
- **Timing:** Used when payment records become out of sync with document totals

## How It Works

### 1. Entity Type Validation
- **Interface Check:** Verifies that the entity implements IHasInstallmentLines interface
- **Document Type:** Ensures the entity is a document file that supports installments
- **Compatibility Validation:** Confirms entity can process installment calculations
- **Error Prevention:** Prevents execution on incompatible entity types

### 2. Installment Line Retrieval
- **Collection Access:** Retrieves all installment lines associated with the document
- **Payment Records:** Accesses payment installment records for calculation
- **Data Gathering:** Collects all payment-related data for processing
- **Relationship Navigation:** Navigates entity relationships to find payment data

### 3. Payment Calculation Processing
- **Paid Amount Calculation:** Calculates total paid amounts from installment records
- **Remaining Balance:** Determines remaining unpaid amounts
- **System Field Updates:** Updates system-maintained paid and remaining amount fields
- **Accuracy Restoration:** Ensures financial figures match actual payment records

### 4. Result Accumulation
