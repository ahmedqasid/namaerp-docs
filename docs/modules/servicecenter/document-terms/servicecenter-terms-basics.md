# Document Terms in Service Center

Two workshops running the same Nama installation can behave completely differently. One closes a job
order and a stock issue comes out of it; the other closes an identical job order and nothing leaves
the store. One car receipt brings the chassis into stock; the next branch's car receipt is a piece of
paper. Nobody wrote any code to make that happen — the difference lives entirely in the **document
term** (توجيه المستند).

Every Service Center document you save carries two things at the top of the screen: a **book**, which
decides how it is numbered, and a **term**, which decides how it behaves. The book is bookkeeping
hygiene. The term is the configuration — and, alongside [the module configuration screen](/modules/servicecenter/servicecenter-configuration.md), it is where most Service Center behaviour is decided.

`srvcenter` for the workshop documents. The car documents also need `srvcenter-subitems`, the policy
documents `srvcenter-insurance-and-installments`, the rental documents `srvcenter-rental-assets`, and
the courier documents `srvcenter-mobile-delivery`.

## What a term actually decides

A term is a saved rulebook for one document type. You can have as many as you like — a term per
branch, a term per workflow, a term for the cash counter and another for the credit counter — and you
choose which one applies each time you raise a document.

Across Service Center, the settings on a term fall into four families. Learn these four and every
term screen in the module becomes readable, whichever document it belongs to.

**Accounts.** Most terms carry one or more pairs of accounting sides — a debit and a credit — which
say where the document's money lands in the ledger. Al-Sahra Motors' [job-order closing](/modules/servicecenter/job-cycle/servicecenter-job-order-closing.md) term, for
instance, names the pair that receives the customer share of a finished repair.

**Generation settings.** Several documents do their real work by creating a *second* document: a job
order closing creates the stock issue for the consumed parts; a [car receipt](/modules/servicecenter/car-purchasing/car-receipt.md) creates the stock receipt
that brings the chassis into the showroom store. The term names the **book and term of the document
to be generated**. This is the single most consequential block in the module, and the one this
documentation warns about most.

**Stamping settings.** Service Center terms are unusually chatty with master files. A workshop term
can move the [**vehicle's status**](/modules/servicecenter/cars-setup/car-status-configurations.md) when the document commits, and fire a notification when it does. A
car term can stamp a dozen back-references onto the car record — which invoice sold it, which traffic
letter was issued, which salesperson handled it.

**Behaviour switches.** The rest are plain rules: refuse the gate pass until the customer invoice is
paid, refuse the closing until every part has been issued, copy the job order's planned parts onto
the issue, split a quantity of six into six separate car records.

## Which documents share which term

A term is written against a **family** of documents, not always against one. Where two documents
share a family, one term record serves both — and a setting you make for one silently applies to the
other, which is worth knowing before you tune anything.

| Term family | Documents that use it |
|---|---|
| Common workshop documents | Service Request, Job Estimation, Estimation Update, Add Task To Job Order, Pending Operation, Resume Operation, Product Inspection Document |
| Job Order | Job Order |
| Job Order Closing | Job Order Closing |
| Gate Pass | Gate Pass |
| Job Order Execution | Job Order Execution (the menu reads *Production Review*) |
| External Repair | External Repair |
| Spare Parts Issue | Spare Parts Issue |
| Spare Parts Issue Request | Spare Parts Issue Request |
| Spare Parts Return | Spare Parts Return |
| Car sales documents | Sales Quotation Request, Sales Quotation, Sales Approval, Sales Order, Sales Order Cancel, Allocation, Allocation Cancel, Pro-forma Sales Invoice, Final Delivery, Final Delivery Cancel, Traffic Letter Request, Traffic Letter Request Cancel, Traffic Letter, Traffic Letter Cancel |
| Car receipt documents | Car Receipt, Car Receipt Cancel |
| Car Sales Invoice | Car Sales Invoice |
| Car Sales Return | Car Sales Return |
| Car Purchase Order | Car Purchase Order |
| Car Pro-forma Purchase Invoice | Car Pro-forma Purchase Invoice |
| Car Purchase Invoice | Car Purchase Invoice |
| Car Purchase Return | Car Purchase Return |
| Sub Item Assembly Document | Sub Item Assembly Document — the only document in the module that needs the **`supplychain-assembly`** licence on top of `srvcenter-subitems` |
| Insurance Policy Order | Insurance Policy Order, Insurance Policy Renewal |
| Insurance Policy Receipt | Insurance Policy Receipt |
| Insurance Purchase Invoice | Insurance Purchase Invoice |
| Rental | Rental Request, Rental Invoice |
| Reservation Cancel | Reservation Cancel |
| Delivery Document | Delivery Document |
| Batch Delivery Document | Batch Delivery Document |
| Invoice Receipt Document | Invoice Receipt Document |

Twenty-six families for eighty-odd documents — which means most of your configuration effort goes
into a handful of screens. The two that repay attention first are the [**Job Order**](/modules/servicecenter/job-cycle/servicecenter-job-order.md) term and the
[**Car sales**](/modules/servicecenter/car-sales/car-sales-cycle.md) term, because between them they cover the whole of both halves of the business.

## Nine documents have no term at all

Some documents in this module have nothing to configure. Their document book still shows a *توجيه*
tab, but there is no term class behind it, so there is no rulebook to write and nothing you can tune
per book:

- Attendance
- Odometer Reading Log
- Product Task Opening
- Customer Insurance Policy
- Insurance Policy Delivery
- Insurance Policy Cancellation
- Insurance Policy Period Adjustment
- Insurance Policy Value Adjustment
- Instalment Quotation

Five of those nine are insurance-policy documents, so more than half of the insurance sub-module's
documents behave one way and one way only. If you have been hunting for the switch that makes a
policy delivery post something, stop hunting — there is no switch, and the document posts nothing.

## The rule that governs the other two pages

Here is the habit to build, because it is what separates a working configuration from a
plausible-looking one:

::: warning An account block on a term screen does not prove the document posts
Several Service Center term screens are assembled from a shared layout that carries the full
accounting block — debit, credit, cash, taxes, eight discount accounts — regardless of whether the
document behind it ever produces a journal entry. Filling those fields on a document that does not
post produces **no error, no warning, and no entry**. You simply never see the money.

The two worst offenders are named on the [car, insurance and rental terms
page](/modules/servicecenter/document-terms/servicecenter-terms-cars-and-other.md): the four **traffic
letter** documents, and the **Car Pro-forma Purchase Invoice**. Treat every account block as
unproven until you have committed one document and looked for the entry.
:::

The pro-forma deserves a second sentence, because it is not merely inert:

::: danger The Car Pro-forma Purchase Invoice can acquire entries out of band
Committing a Car Pro-forma Purchase Invoice posts nothing, no matter what is on its term. But the
generic **More → Regenerate Accounting Effects** action on that same document *does* reach the
ledger and *does* create entries from those accounts. A document that has never posted can suddenly
sprout a journal entry because somebody used a menu item. Document the pro-forma internally as a
non-financial document and leave its account fields empty.
:::

## Generation: the switch that lies, and the two that double

The generation block is where terms cause real damage, and always in the same two ways.

::: warning "Generate Document" does not always stop generation
On the **Car Receipt**, the **Car Final Delivery**, the **Spare Parts Issue** and the **Spare Parts
Return**, the *Generate Document(s)* / *إنشاء مستندات تلقائيا* tick box is not consulted. Whatever
you set, these documents look only at the **Generation Book** and **Generation Term**. Unticking the
box and leaving the book filled still produces the stock document.

To stop generation on those four documents you must **clear the generation book and the generation
term**. Nothing else works.

The same applies to *Manual Generation* on the car receipt and the final delivery, and to the whole
generation block on the **Spare Parts Issue Request**, which generates nothing under any setting.
:::

And then the two symmetric traps. They are the reason this page exists at all, because a document
term is the only place a reader can act on them.

::: danger Stock in — the car can be received twice
Both the **Car Receipt** and the [**Car Purchase Invoice**](/modules/servicecenter/car-purchasing/car-purchase-invoice.md) are able to generate a Stock Receipt for
the same chassis, and neither can see the other's stock document. Configure both and the car arrives
in stock **twice**, at double cost, with no error at all.

**The safe rule: fill the generation Book and Term on exactly one of the two terms.** Al-Sahra Motors
generates on the purchase invoice (`SIPI-2026-021` produced stock receipt `STR-2026-0552`) and leaves
the car receipt's generation book and term **empty**, so car receipt `SIR-2026-0088` records the
physical arrival, the accessory checklist and the parking slots and moves nothing. Remember that
unticking *Generate Document* on the receipt is not enough — blank the book and the term.

Treat the two documents as **alternatives**, never as a sequence.
:::

::: danger Stock out — the car can be issued twice
The mirror image. Both the [**Car Sales Invoice**](/modules/servicecenter/car-sales/car-sales-invoice.md) and the **Car Final Delivery** are able to generate
a Stock Issue for the same chassis, and again neither sees the other's document. Configure both and
the car leaves stock twice, its cost is relieved twice, and on-hand goes negative — silently, or with
a shortage error that names a stock document nobody created by hand.

**Same rule: fill the generation Book and Term on exactly one of the two terms.** Al-Sahra issues
from the sales invoice (`SISI-2026-0498` produced stock issue `STI-2026-1201`) and leaves the final
delivery's generation book and term empty, so `SIFD-2026-0357` is purely the hand-over record. And
again: unticking *Generate Document* on the final delivery does nothing — blank the book and the
term.
