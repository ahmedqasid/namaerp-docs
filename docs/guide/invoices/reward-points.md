## STC Qitaf Integration Setup

### Generating CSR for STC Qitaf Certificate

When integrating with STC Qitaf loyalty program, STC will request a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) file. They will provide you with the following information:
- **Partner ID** - Your unique partner identifier
- **Country** - Country code (e.g., SA)
- **City** - City name (e.g., Riyadh)
- **Organization** - Your organization name

#### Step 1: Generate the CSR and Private Key

Run the following OpenSSL command, replacing the values with your information:

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
  -keyout qitaf-{PartnerID}.key \
  -out qitaf-{PartnerID}.csr \
  -subj "/C=SA/ST={State}/L={City}/O={OrganizationName}/CN=qitaf-{PartnerID}"
```

For example, if your partner ID is 2244 and you're located in Riyadh:

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
  -keyout qitaf-2244.key \
  -out qitaf-2244.csr \
  -subj "/C=SA/ST=Riyadh/L=Riyadh/O=YourCompanyName/CN=qitaf-2244"
```

This creates two files:
- `qitaf-2244.key` - Your private key (keep this secure and never share it)
- `qitaf-2244.csr` - The CSR file to send to STC

::: warning Keep Your Private Key Secure
Never share the `.key` file with anyone. Only send the `.csr` file to STC.
:::

#### Step 2: Send CSR to STC

Send only the `.csr` file to STC. They will process it and send back a signed certificate file.

#### Step 3: Configure in Nama ERP

1. Open the **Reward Points Config** screen
2. Upload the certificate file (received from STC) to the **Certificate** field - the file is usually named `qitaf-{YourPartnerID}-{SomeSerialNumber}.pem.txt`
3. Upload your private key file (e.g., `qitaf-2244.key`) to the **Private Key** field
4. Fill in the remaining configuration:
   - API URL
   - Client ID (Username)
   - Client Password
   - Merchant Token (API Token)
   - Branch and Terminal ID mappings

::: tip Backup Your Files
Keep secure backups of your private key file and the certificate file from STC.

### Debugging STC Qitaf Requests

If you encounter issues with the STC Qitaf integration, you can enable debug logging to capture the full request and response details.

#### Enabling Debug Logging

Add the following property to your `nama.properties` file:

```properties
debug-stc-qitaf=true
```

When enabled, the system logs each API request as a curl command along with the full response. This makes it easy to share the exact request details with STC support or reproduce the request manually.

#### Sample Log Output

The logged curl command includes the `--cert` and `--key` arguments with the file names from the Reward Points Config, making it easy to reproduce the request:

```
========== STC QITAF REQUEST ==========
curl -X POST 'https://api.qitaf.stc.com.sa/redemption/otp' \
  --cert 'qitaf-2244-123456.pem.txt' \
  --key 'qitaf-2244.key' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Secret-Token: your-merchant-token' \
  -H 'GlobalId: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000' \
  -d '{"Msisdn":501234567,"BranchId":"B001","TerminalId":"T001","RequestDate":"2024-01-15T10:30:00"}'
========================================

========== STC QITAF RESPONSE ==========
Status: 200 OK
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{"status":"success","message":"OTP sent successfully"}
=========================================
```

#### Running the curl Command

To run the logged curl command:

1. Download the **Certificate** and **Private Key** files from the Reward Points Config
2. Place them in the directory where you'll run the curl command
3. Copy and run the curl command from the logs

::: warning Sensitive Information
