# The Car Dealership in Nama

Al-Sahra Motors runs two businesses on one plot of land. On one side is the service centre, which
repairs anybody's car. On the other is the showroom, which buys NAWA cars from the importer, keeps
them in a yard, and sells them. This half of the documentation is about the showroom.

A car in a showroom is an awkward thing for an ERP system to hold. It is stock — it has a cost, it
sits in a warehouse, it is sold and relieved to cost of sales like any other item. But it is not
interchangeable stock. When Layla Al-Harbi buys a NAWA Rimal 2.4 she does not buy "one unit of item
`MDL-RIMAL24`", she buys **chassis `NWA7R24C26K000318`** — the one with 12 kilometres on the clock,
the one whose customs release came through on Tuesday, the one parked in slot `A-14` with key `K-318`
in the cabinet. Every question anybody asks about that car — where is it, who is it promised to, has
its traffic letter come back, what did it actually cost us — is a question about that individual
vehicle, not about the model.

So Nama gives each physical car its own master-file record, and hangs it off the ordinary
supply-chain item as an **item dimension**. The item stays what it always was — NAWA Rimal 2.4, one
line in the item file, with a selling price and an item group. The car record is the individual unit
underneath it, and it is what the line on a purchase invoice, a stock receipt or a sales invoice
actually points at.

## The vocabulary bridge — read this before anything else

The same object has two names, and you will meet both on your first day.

- In the **menu** and on its own screen it is **السياره / Customer Car**.
- In roughly forty configuration options and
  [document-term option labels](/modules/servicecenter/document-terms/servicecenter-terms-cars-and-other.md)
  it is **الصنف الفرعي / Sub Item**.

*Create Sub Item From Line Information*, *Default SubItem Configuration*, *SubItem Status
Movements* — every one of those options is talking about the car record. There is no separate
"sub item" screen to hunt for. Throughout these pages we call it **the car record** or **the car
file** in prose, and reproduce the on-screen label verbatim whenever we quote a field.

## What is on a car record

One record, one physical vehicle. It carries:

- **Identity** — chassis number, engine number, model (free text), gearbox, body type, number of
  passengers, colour-style classifiers.
- **The warranty pack** — has catalogue, has mats, has toolkit, has spare key, has warranty, the
  warranty period and any extended warranty, and who provides it.
- **Where it physically is** — warehouse, locator, key number, slot number, plate number, mileage,
  condition, PDI details.
- **The paperwork** — customs list number, customs paid flag and date, customs release number and
  date, vessel name, carrier, the OEM documents block and the registration documents block.
- **A read-only trail** — which purchase order, purchase invoice, stock receipt, sales order, sales
  invoice, traffic letter and salesperson touched it, and the complete list of status changes.

All of it is described field by field on [The Car File](/modules/servicecenter/cars-setup/car-master-file.md).

## The two registers are separate

Nama holds **two** vehicle files, and they are not connected.

| | The car record | [The workshop's product file](/modules/servicecenter/workshop-setup/servicecenter-product-file.md) |
|---|---|---|
| Menu | `سيارات` (cars) > ملفات السيارات | مركز خدمة > الملفات > منتج |
| What it is | A serialised unit of a supply-chain item | The customer's vehicle as a serviced asset |
| Carries | Chassis, customs, warehouse slot, sales stamps | Odometer history, service contract, last-service register |
| Used by | Purchase, receipt, allocation, sales, delivery | Service requests, estimations, job orders, gate passes |
| Licence | `srvcenter-subitems` | `srvcenter` |
| Status values | Its own 20-value list, entirely configured | A different, workshop-specific list |

Al-Sahra sells `CAR-000318` to Layla in March, and if Layla brings it back for its first service in
September the workshop opens a **new and unrelated** product file for it. Nothing carries over: not
the chassis number, not the warranty pack, not the purchase history.

::: warning There is no link between the sold car and the serviced car
Two fields exist in the data model that look as though they would join the two registers, but they
are on no screen and nothing reads or writes them. A workshop cannot look up the dealership record,
and a dealership record does not know its car has been serviced.

If you need the two joined — for example so a warranty claim can be checked against the sale date —
that is a configuration project at your site, not a product feature. It is not something you switch
on.
:::

## Nothing about a car's behaviour is built in

This is the single most important sentence in this half of the documentation, and every page here
repeats it in some form.

You would reasonably expect that a purchase invoice makes a car *In Transit*, a receipt makes it
*Free Stock*, and a sales invoice makes it *Invoiced*. **None of that is true out of the box.** The
only status the product itself ever assigns is the very first one, *ما قبل المبدئي / Pre Initial*,
stamped at the moment a car record is created from a document line. Everything after that — which
document sets which status, and which moves from one status to another are even legal — is drawn by
you, per item, in a **Car Status Configurations** record.

Two dealerships running the identical documents can have completely different status behaviour, and
a dealership that never fills in the configuration will find that every document saves happily and
changes nothing. How to draw the lifecycle is the subject of
[Car Status Configurations](/modules/servicecenter/cars-setup/car-status-configurations.md).

## Before any of it works

::: danger The cars half is switched off by default and needs four separate pieces of setup
It is not enough to hold the `srvcenter-subitems` licence. Until all four of these are in place, the
car records either never appear or never get created — and in the most common failure nothing is
reported at all.

1. **The Sub Items feature must be switched on.** The supply-chain feature `scSubItem`
   (*الأصناف الفرعية / Sub Items*) is what makes every car-related field visible in the first place —
   the item's *Has Sub Item* tick, the item's configuration slots, and the **السياره (Customer Car)**
   column on document lines. A database migrator **adds it to the Config Group's *Prevented
   Features* list on upgrade**, so on a real installation it starts life switched off. Remove it from
   *Prevented Features* before you look for anything else.
2. **The item must be flagged as having sub items.** On the NAWA Rimal 2.4 item, tick *Has Sub
   Item*. Decide this before you transact — the flag is locked once the item has movements.
3. **The item must carry a Car Status Configurations record.** It is attached at
   *Item ▸ Configurations ▸ Car Status Configurations*, and automatic car creation refuses to run
   without it, failing with *"Item … does not have Car Status Configurations"*. Note the message is
   reported against the **item** column of the document line, which sends most people hunting in the
   wrong place.
4. **You must add the chassis and engine columns to your purchase screen.** Out of the box **no**
   Car Purchases screen shows a chassis number, an engine number, a gearbox or a key/slot column.
   The Car Receipt shows only the five warranty-pack tick boxes; the Purchase Order, Proforma
   Purchase Invoice, Purchase Invoice and Purchase Return show none of it. So the feature that reads
   the chassis number off the line has, as shipped, nowhere for anyone to type a chassis number. Add
   the line-grid columns through a screen modification **before** you rely on automatic car creation.
:::

::: warning The module-level *Default SubItem Configuration* does not do what its name suggests
There is an option on the Service Center settings screen called
**إعدادات حالة الصنف الفرعي الإفتراضية / Default SubItem Configuration**. It supplies the status
filter rows used by the car picker on document lines when the **item** has no configuration of its
own — and that is all it does.

It is **not** a fallback for the status engine, and it is **not** a fallback for automatic car
creation. Both of those read the item's own configuration and refuse to proceed without it. Filling
in the module default and expecting the rest to follow is the most common setup mistake in this
half of the module; each vehicle model still needs its own **Car Status Configurations** attached to
its item.
:::

::: warning Nothing checks that a chassis number is unique
There is no uniqueness constraint and no validation on the chassis number anywhere. You can create
two car records carrying the identical chassis, from two documents or by hand, and the system will
accept both, give each its own code, and track stock and cost against each separately. Nothing warns
and nothing merges them.

The practical consequence is that the discipline has to be yours: switch automatic creation on for
exactly one document type, and search the car file before creating one by hand.

## What is in the `cars` menu

The English menu root reads **`cars`**, in lower case — reproduce it as it is when telling somebody
where to click. In Arabic it is **سيارات**. Underneath it are seven folders:

| Folder | Arabic | What lives there |
|---|---|---|
| Car Files | ملفات السيارات | The car record, Car Status Configurations, Insurance Company, External Agency |
| [Car Purchases](/modules/servicecenter/car-purchasing/car-purchase-invoice.md) | مشتريات السيارات | Purchase order, proforma purchase invoice, purchase invoice, purchase return, assembly |
| [Car Inventory](/modules/servicecenter/car-purchasing/car-receipt.md) | مخازن السيارات | Car receipt and car receipt cancel |
| [Car Sales](/modules/servicecenter/car-sales/car-sales-cycle.md) | مبيعات السيارات | Quotation request, quotation, sales order, approval, allocation, invoices, delivery, return, traffic letters |
| Cars Sales Cancellation | الغاء مبيعات سيارات | The cancel documents for the sales chain |
| Car Insurance | تأمين السيارات | Insurance programmes, policies and the seven policy documents |
| Car Installment | تقسيط السيارات | Finance companies, instalment programmes and quotations |

Two of those folders hold master files that surprise people by their location. **Insurance Company**
sits in Car Files, not in Car Insurance, and it belongs to this licence — which means an
insurance-only customer cannot create one. And **External Agency** sits there too.

## External Agency

**الجهة الخارجية / External Agency** is a small party master file in **cars > Car Files**. It can
carry a subsidiary account and tax data like any other party, and it exists so a site can register
the outside bodies it deals with — a traffic department office, a clearing agent, an inspection
centre.

It is worth being blunt about it: **no document in the module references an External Agency.** It
takes part in no car flow, no purchase, no sale and no accounting entry. Record them if the list is
useful to you, and do not expect anything to consume it.

## Where to go next

- [The Car File](/modules/servicecenter/cars-setup/car-master-file.md) — the record itself, tab by
  tab, and which fields are typed by a person versus written by a document.
- [Car Status Configurations](/modules/servicecenter/cars-setup/car-status-configurations.md) — how
  to draw the lifecycle, the full status catalogue, and the rules that decide whether a document is
  accepted.
- [Ordering Cars](/modules/servicecenter/car-purchasing/car-purchase-order.md) — the start of the
  buying chain, where most sites choose to have their car records born.
