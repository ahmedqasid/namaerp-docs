# EAGenerateMyFatoorahPaymentURLs

**This document was generated using Claude.ai**

## Overview

Generates MyFatoorah payment URLs for documents supporting online payment processing, creating payment links through MyFatoorah's gateway for Middle East region payment methods.

## When This Action Runs

MyFatoorah payment URL generation for documents implementing ISupportOnlinePaymentDoc interface (invoices, orders, bills).

## How It Works

1. **Validates entity compatibility** with ISupportOnlinePaymentDoc interface
2. **Validates MyFatoorah configuration** exists and type is MyFatoorah
3. **Evaluates country code parameter** — if the value contains `'`, `"`, or `+`, it is treated as a constant value; otherwise it is resolved as a field reference
4. **Extracts customer information** from specified entity fields (name required, contact details optional)
5. **Creates payment invoice** through MyFatoorah API via `MyFatoorahPaymentUtil`
6. **Assigns generated URL** to the target field:
   - If the entity is in **draft** state, the field is set directly
   - If the entity is **not draft**, the field is updated via `doSetWhileForceStable` and the last change version is incremented
