# Documents & Details Configuration

This page documents the **Documents & Details** tab — how stock document lines are laid out, which dimensions can be entered per line, the extra columns and grids you can add to documents, delivery handling, and warehouse/locator filtering.

## Dimensions & Warehouse on Lines

By default a stock document carries one warehouse and one set of accounting dimensions for the whole document. These switches let each **line** carry its own value instead.

**Warehouse in Details** (`value.warehouseInDetails`) — Lets each line carry its own warehouse, so a single document can move items across more than one warehouse.

**Analysis Set / Branch / Sector / Department in Details** — Each lets the corresponding accounting dimension be entered per line rather than only at the header, when different lines belong to different dimensions.

| Option | Field ID |
|---|---|
| Analysis Set in Details | `value.analysisSetInDetails` |
| Branch in Details | `value.branchInDetails` |
| Sector in Details | `value.sectorInDetails` |
| Department in Details | `value.departmentInDetails` |

**Salesman in Details** (`value.salesManInDetails`) — Lets each line carry its own salesman (and, with the option below, governs how the purchases man behaves per line). Use it when commission/attribution must be split among salesmen on one document.

**Salesman from Header if Detail is Empty** (`value.salesManFromHeaderIfDetEmpty`) — Only relevant when *Salesman in Details* is on: a line with no salesman is filled from the header, while a salesman already on the line is kept. With it off, the header value overrides the line whenever the header has one. The same applies to the purchases man.

**Purchases Man in Details** (`value.purchasesManInDetails`) — Shows the purchases man column on document lines (its per-line/header fill behavior follows the salesman options above).

## Document Behavior

**Quantity Before Value** (`value.quantityBeforeValue`) — Controls column order on the detail grid: when on, quantity columns appear before the value/price columns. A data-entry preference.

**Hide Old Track Quantity Settings from Term Config** (`value.hideTrackQtyFromTermConfig`) *(default on)* — Hides the legacy quantity-tracking settings from the Document Term screen, since the newer mechanism below replaces them. Keep on unless you still rely on the old per-term settings.

**Use System Table to Track Quantities** (`value.useEntriesForTrackQuantities`) — Switches quantity tracking (the running "how much of this line has been delivered/satisfied" balance between linked documents) to a dedicated system table maintained automatically as documents are processed and deleted. This is the modern, recommended way to track delivered/remaining quantities across the document chain.

**Allow Non-System Term and Book in Assembly Document Term** (`value.allowNonSystemTermAndBook`) — On the assembly document term, this normally forces issued/received items to use the system-defined book and term. When on, you may assign your own (non-system) book and term for the issue and receipt sides.

**Copy Item Name with Entry and Keep It** (`value.copyItemNameWithEntryAndKeepIt`) — When an item is entered, its name is copied onto the line and kept even if it would otherwise be recomputed — useful when the captured name should be preserved for printing.

**Show To-Item Dimensions in Transfer and Use Them** (`value.showToItemDimensionsInTransfer`) — On stock transfers, shows and uses the destination "to-item" dimensions, so a transfer can map the item's dimensions on the receiving side (e.g. re-labeling color/size on transfer).

**Copy Line Dimensions Using Legacy Method** (`value.copyLineDimensionsUsingLegacyMethod`) — A compatibility switch: copies line dimensions between documents using the older method. Enable only if line-dimension copying must match historical behavior.

**Enable Pick Lines Usage** (`value.enablePickLinesUsage`) — Turns on the picking (pick-lines) workflow for sales documents. Enable when warehouse picking against sales documents is part of your fulfillment.

**Show Final Materials in Multi-Assembly Document** (`value.showFinalMaterialsGridInMultiAssembly`) — Adds a "final materials" grid to the Multi-Assembly document, summarizing the consolidated materials across the assembly.

**Only Add Alternative Material Found in Issued Material When Creating Assembly Alternative Material** (`value.onlyAddAltMaterialFoundInIssuedMaterialInAssemblyDocumentWhenCreatingAssemblyAltMaterial`) — When creating an Assembly Alternative-Material document, restricts the offered alternatives to materials that actually appear in the assembly's issued materials.

**Do Not Multiply Quantities in Assembly Document** (`value.doNotMultiplyQiesInAssemblyDoc`) — Normally, saving an assembly multiplies component quantities by the assembled quantity. When on, the entered component quantities are taken as-is. Use it when you enter absolute component quantities.

**Default Delivery Status** (`value.defaultDeliveryStatus`) — The delivery status automatically stamped on every new sales document (e.g. "Not Delivered"). Leave empty for no default.

**Use Delivery Organization Files** (`value.useDeliveryOrganization`) — Activates the Delivery Organization feature for drivers — the structure linking delivery zones to branches/warehouses and driving delivery/driver tracking. See the [Delivery & Loading guide](../delivery-and-loading.md).

## Document Grids & Extra Columns

These tables add optional grids or columns to specific document types. Each one (unless noted) takes a list of document types and turns the feature on for those types.

**Detail Grid Configuration Lines** (`value.scGridConfigLines`) *(table)* — Customizes the columns of the line grid on stock documents — which columns appear, their order, and width. Remaining columns are appended afterward.

**Add Quantity Tracking Fields To** (`value.addQtyTrackingFieldsTo`) **/ Add Quantity Tracking Fields To (2)** (`value.addQtyTrackingFieldsTo2`) *(tables)* — Add quantity-tracking columns (requested, satisfied, unsatisfied) to the listed document types' line grids, so staff see the running balance. The second table adds an independent *second* set of tracking columns for documents that need two tracking measures.

**Add Delete-on-Save Field To** (`value.addDeleteOnSaveFieldTo`) *(table)* — Adds a "delete on save" checkbox to each line (plus select-all/unselect-all actions) for the listed document types, so users can mark lines for removal and have them deleted on save.

**Add Gross Weight and Net Weight Fields To** (`value.addGrossWeightAndNetWeightFieldsTo`) *(table)* — Adds gross-weight and tare-weight columns next to the quantity column for the listed document types.

**Dimensions by Suffix** (`value.dimensionsBySuffix`) *(table)* — Encodes item dimensions (color, size, etc.) inside the barcode by position, so scanning resolves not just the item but its specific dimensions.

**Add Generated Docs To** (`value.addGeneratedDocsTo`) *(table)* — Adds a grid (on the screen's last page) listing the documents generated from this one, for the listed document types, so users can see and open downstream documents.

**Add Delivery Table To** (`value.deliveryEntriesFor`) *(table)* — Adds a related-delivery-entries grid onto chosen document types/pages, so deliveries linked to a document can be viewed and managed from its edit screen. Each row chooses the document type, page, and position, and whether to include the document's own and/or the root document's delivery entries.

**Add Delivery Queue Table To** (`value.addDeliveryQueueEntriesTo`) *(table)* — The same idea for the delivery **queue** — adds a delivery-queue grid to chosen document types/pages so queue assignments can be viewed from the document.

**Warehouse Locator Filters** (`value.warehouseLocatorFilters`) *(table)* — Per-document-type rules that limit which warehouses/locators are selectable, optionally restricting to those with available quantity or related to the item, so users only pick from the allowed warehouses/locators for that document type.
