# Screen Modifier — Visual Layout Editor

Filling in dozens of collections by hand is precise, but slow. The **Visual Layout Editor** gives you the same power on a drag-and-drop canvas: you see the screen exactly as users will, rearrange it directly, and save the result straight back into a Screen Modifier record.

## Opening the editor

There are two ways in:

- From a **Screen Modifier** record whose *Applicable For* is **Entity Type** or **EntityType List**, run the **Open In Editor** action.
- From the **list view** of any type, use **Create Screen Modifier** to start a fresh modifier, or **Open Screen Modifier** to jump straight into the editor for that type.

The editor opens the screen for the chosen type (respecting the *For Mobile View* and *For Quick Creator View* flags, and the layout name on the record) and shows it on a canvas you can edit.

::: warning
The editor needs a concrete type to draw, so it is only available when *Applicable For* is **Entity Type** or **EntityType List** — not for the broad *All Screens*, *Master Files* or *Documents* scopes.

## The layout of the editor

The editor has two parts:

- a wide **canvas** on the right that renders the live screen, and
- a **properties panel** on the left where you act on whatever you have selected.

At the top of the panel sit the controls that always apply:

- **Save Changes** — writes everything you've done back into the Screen Modifier. Nothing is persisted until you press it.
- **Page** selector — switch between the screen's pages (tabs).
- **Add Page** / **Delete Page** — add a new tab or remove the current one.
- **Differences** — opens a dialog comparing your edited layout against the base layout, so you can see — and selectively accept — exactly what you've changed.
- **More Actions** — additional layout operations.

Below those, the panel shows **Page**, **Block**, **Field** and **Action** tabs. Which tabs appear depends on what you've clicked on the canvas: select a field and the Field tab opens; select a button and the Action tab opens, and so on.

## Editing a page

The **Page** tab acts on the current tab:

- Set its **Arabic Page Title** and **English Page Title**.
- Add building blocks to it: **Add Group**, **Add Grid**, **Add Action Block**, or **Add Discussion**.
- The **Switch To Page After Move** toggle controls whether, when you move a block to another page, the editor follows it to that page.

## Editing a block

Click any group, grid, actions block or discussion area to select it. The **Block** tab then lets you:

- rename it with an **Arabic Block Title** / **English Block Title**,
- for a **grid**, choose its **Grid Size** (from Tiny up to XXLarge),
- **Modify Fields** (for a group), **Modify Grid Fields** (for a grid) or **Modify Actions** (for an actions block) — each opens a two-column picker where you choose which fields/columns/actions appear and in what order,
- **Add Composite** — add a composite (formula) field to a group,
- **Delete Block** — remove the block from the screen,
- **Copy To Page** / **Move To Page** — duplicate or relocate the block onto another tab.

## Editing a field

Select a single field to open the **Field** tab:

- **Field Id** is shown read-only so you know exactly which field you're on.
- Give it an **Arabic Field Title** / **English Field Title** to override its label.
- **Show In Grid View** (for grid columns) toggles whether the column appears in the grid.
- **Field Layout** (for header fields) controls how the field sits on the form:

  | Layout | Effect |
  | --- | --- |
  | **Normal** | Standard placement, flowing with the other fields. |
  | **Alone** | The field sits on its own line. |
  | **Start New Line** | The field begins a new row. |
  | **Spanned** | The field stretches across more width. |
  | **Spanned 2** | The field stretches across an even wider span. |

- **Edit Composite Props** appears for composite fields, letting you adjust how the combined field is built.
- **Delete Field** removes the field from the screen.

## Editing an action

Select a button to open the **Action** tab, where you can see its **GUI Action Id**, override its **Arabic Action Title** / **English Action Title**, or **Delete Action** to remove it from the screen.

## Saving and applying

Pressing **Save Changes** stores your design in the Screen Modifier. As with any modifier, the change does not reach users until the screens are rebuilt — run **Regenerate GUI For Applicable Types Only** (or **Regenerate Screens**) and reopen the screen to confirm. See [Overview & Concepts](/platform/screen-modifier/screen-modifier-overview.md#Making-your-changes-take-effect) for the full rebuild rhythm.

::: warning Automatic additions are suppressed once you design a screen here
When a screen is built through the visual editor, Nama treats your design as complete and stops layering its own automatic additions on top of it — things like the "related documents" links grid or other module-specific blocks it would normally inject. If a screen loses one of those pieces after you redesign it, turn on **Allow System Modifiers** on the Screen Modifier's main tab (see [Priority and Activation](/platform/screen-modifier/screen-modifier-overview.md#Priority-and-Activation)) to keep them.
