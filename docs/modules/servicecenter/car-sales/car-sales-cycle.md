# The Car Sales Cycle

Selling a car is not like selling a bag of cement. Nobody cares *which* bag of cement leaves the
warehouse, but a customer who buys a car buys **one specific chassis** — and from the moment she
picks it, that chassis has to be followed through enquiry, order, invoice and hand-over as an
individual object with a history of its own.

That is what the whole **Car Sales** area exists to do. Every document in it names a car record, and
every document leaves a mark on that record's history. What the marks mean, and which move is legal
after which, is the part that surprises people: it is not built into the product at all.

Everything on this page needs `srvcenter-subitems`. Nothing in
[the cars half of Service Center](/modules/servicecenter/cars-setup/servicecenter-cars-overview.md)
is available on a base installation.

## Configuration decides almost everything here

Before the chain itself, the sentence that governs the entire folder.

A car's lifecycle in Nama is **drawn by you, not shipped with the product**. Each car model (the
inventory item) carries a
[**Car Status Configuration**](/modules/servicecenter/cars-setup/car-status-configurations.md), and
that configuration holds two tables:

- which document pushes the car to which status, and
- which status-to-status moves are legal at all.

If that configuration is missing or empty, **every document on this page still saves perfectly, and
changes nothing on the car** — no status, no allocation, no history line. No error, no warning. The
documents commit, the money and stock effects that belong to them happen, and the car record sits
exactly as it was.

So when a page here says "the car moves to *Allocated*", read it as: *if the site configured a
status updater line for this document.* That qualifier applies everywhere and is not repeated in
every sentence.

::: warning There is no built-in chain either
Nothing forces a sales invoice to be built on a sales order, or an allocation to exist before an
invoice. The chain is made by the ordinary **From Document (بناءا على)** field plus the status
movement table. Two consequences worth knowing on day one:

- **From Document is what filters the car picker.** With a source document named, the *Customer Car*
  column offers only the cars already on that source. Leave the chain honest and the picker keeps
  you honest with it.
- **Copying forward is a snapshot.** Prices and quantities copied onto the next document do not stay
  linked to the previous one; editing the order after the invoice exists changes nothing on the
  invoice.

```

| Step | What it contributes | Must you use it? |
|---|---|---|
| Quotation Request | Records that the enquiry happened | No |
| Quotation | Records the price you offered | No |
| Sales Approval | An internal record of the deal, complete with the payment plan | No |
| Sales Order | The agreed price, the payment method and schedule, the [financing block](/modules/servicecenter/car-installments/car-installment-programs.md), the booking deposit | Not enforced by anything, but everything downstream copies from it |
| Allocation | Stamps a customer, branch, department, salesman and warehouse onto one chassis | No — and nothing downstream reads the stamp |
| Proforma Sales Invoice | A priced, payable-looking document you can hand to a bank | No |
| **Sales Invoice** | **Revenue, tax, receivable, cost of goods sold, the stock issue, the e-invoice** | **Yes — this is the sale** |
| Final Delivery | The hand-over event, and a stock issue *if its term is configured to generate one* | No |

### The two record-only openers

The **Car Sales Quotation Request** (`سيارات > مبيعات السيارات > طلب عرض أسعار سيارة`) and the
**Car Sales Quotation** (`… > عرض أسعار سيارة`) are exactly what they look like: paperwork. They
post nothing to the ledger and they move no stock. What they *do* give you is a searchable record of
the enquiry and the offered price, a status movement on the car if you configured one, and — if the
document term switches it on — a reference stamped back onto the car record's Statistics tab, so
anyone opening `CAR-000318` can see which quotation it was offered on.

Neither has a cancellation document. If a quotation is wrong, delete it or raise another one.

### The point of no return

**The Car Sales Invoice is the only document in this chain that books money.** It is the only one
whose effects are unconditional: revenue, tax, the customer receivable, the cost of goods sold and
the stock issue that takes the car out of the showroom. Every step before it can be undone by
deleting the document or by raising its matching cancellation document. After it, the only way back
is a **Car Sales Return**.

The pro-forma sales invoice, despite its name and its full invoice layout, is not a financial
document — see [Car Sales Invoices](/modules/servicecenter/car-sales/car-sales-invoice.md).

::: danger The car can be issued from stock twice
Both the **Car Sales Invoice** and the **Car Final Delivery** can generate a stock issue, and
**neither can see the other's**. Follow the natural path — invoice the car, then deliver it — with
both document terms configured to generate, and the same chassis leaves stock **twice**: the cost is
relieved to cost of sales twice and the car sits at −1 on hand, silently. If negative stock is
blocked for that item, you get a confusing shortage error naming an auto-generated stock document
rather than the car document you were saving.

**The rule: fill *Generation Book* and *Generation Term* on exactly one of the two document terms.**
At Al-Sahra Motors the sales invoice generates the issue, so the final-delivery term's generation
book and term are left **empty**.

Note that **unticking *Generate Document* does not stop the final delivery** — that switch is
ignored by this document. Blanking the book and the term is the only thing that works. Treat the
invoice and the final delivery as **alternatives for moving stock, never as a sequence**.
:::

## The showroom thread, end to end

Al-Sahra Motors, the authorised NAWA dealer in Riyadh, has six Rimal 2.4s in the showroom, each
landed at **76,500** (74,000 from the importer plus 2,500 of freight and customs). Layla Al-Harbi
walks in on 20 February 2026 and leaves in March with `CAR-000318`.

1. **20 February — the enquiry.** Sales quotation request `SISQR-2026-0091` records that Layla asked
   about a Rimal 2.4. Nothing else happens.
2. **21 February — the offer.** Sales quotation `SISQ-2026-0102` offers **89,500**. Still paperwork.
3. **24 February — the deal.** Sales order `SISO-2026-0233` at the negotiated **87,000**, cash sale,
   with a **5,000 booking deposit**. That deposit is the only journal entry anywhere before the
   invoice.
4. **25 February — the chassis is pinned.** Allocation `SIA-2026-0311` stamps Layla, the Riyadh
   branch and salesperson `EMP-131` Sara Al-Dosari onto chassis `NWA7R24C26K000318`, and moves the
   car to *Allocated*.
5. **1 March — the sale.** Sales invoice `SISI-2026-0498`: **87,000 net, 13,050 VAT, 100,050 total**,
   against a **76,500** cost of sales, a **10,500** gross margin, and stock issue `STI-2026-1201`
   out of `WH-SHOW`. Past this point, only a return will unwind it.
6. **1–2 March — the paperwork.** Traffic letter request `SITLR-2026-0288` then traffic letter
   `SITL-2026-0296`, so the car can be registered and plated. Neither posts anything.
7. **3 March — the hand-over.** Final delivery `SIFD-2026-0357`. Its term has **no** generation book
   or term, so it issues nothing — the invoice already did that.
8. **5 March — the plates come back.** Plate `ر ط ص 8318` is typed on the car's own screen by hand.
   No document writes it.

That last line is not an oversight in the story. It is the single most common wrong expectation in
this half of the module, and it has its own section on
[Handing the Car Over](/modules/servicecenter/car-sales/car-final-delivery.md).

## How the car's history is built

Every document that names a car writes a **status history line** on that car, and the car's current
status is simply the **last line in the chain**. That chain is not appended blindly: on every save,
all the lines for that car — from every document — are re-sorted by value date and replayed from the
start. Each transition must find a legal move in the configuration, or the save is refused with a
message naming the car, the two statuses and the document.

Two practical consequences:

- **A back-dated document re-derives everything.** Slot a document in between two existing ones and
  the whole chain is replayed around it. A move that was legal yesterday can become illegal, and the
  document that fails is not necessarily the one you are saving.
- **Order is enforced only by that replay.** There is no other sequencing check anywhere in the car
  sales family. If your configuration allows *Received → Invoiced*, the system will let you invoice
  a car you never allocated, and will not mention it.

[The car's own screen](/modules/servicecenter/cars-setup/car-master-file.md) shows the whole audit
trail on its **Statistics** tab, alongside the reference
fields each document stamps — the sales order, the sales invoice, the traffic letter and so on.
That tab is the first place to look when someone asks "what happened to this car?".

## What each document does to the money and the stock

The honest summary, which the rest of the folder expands:

| Document | Accounting | Inventory | Effect on the car |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sales Quotation Request | none | none | status line; quotation-request stamp |
| Sales Quotation | none | none | status line; quotation stamp |
| Sales Approval | only the generic debit/credit pair, and only if the term fills it | none | status line |
| Sales Order | the generic pair if filled, **plus** the booking deposit | none | status line; sales-order and salesman stamps |
| Allocation | **none** | none | writes the five allocation fields; status line |
| Proforma Sales Invoice | only the generic pair if the term fills it | **none** | status line |
| **Sales Invoice** | **full sales posting, always** | **out, via a stock issue** | status line; sales-invoice stamp |
| Final Delivery | **none** | **out, via a stock issue — only if its term names a generation book and term** | status line; delivery-date stamp |
| Sales Return | full reversal | **in, via a stock receipt** | status line |
| The cancellation documents | **none** | **none** | mark the source cancelled; status line |

::: warning Accounts on a term screen do not prove the document posts
[The document term screens](/modules/servicecenter/document-terms/servicecenter-terms-cars-and-other.md)
for the allocation, the final delivery, the quotations and all four cancellation documents show a
complete block of debit, credit, cash, tax and discount accounts.
**Those documents never post.** Anything you configure there is ignored — no journal entry appears,
and nothing tells you why. Fill accounts only on the sales order, the sales approval, the pro-forma
sales invoice, the sales invoice and the sales return.
:::

Where a document does post or move stock, the effect is created as a **business request** processed
in the background, so the document itself saves instantly. If an effect fails, it is retried from
the **Business Requests** list view — filter by failed, select the rows, and use **More →
Reprocess / Recommit**.

  record and the one setup rule that keeps stock correct.
- [Taking a Car Back](/modules/servicecenter/car-sales/car-sales-return.md) — what a return reverses
  and what it leaves behind.
- [Cancellation Documents](/modules/servicecenter/car-sales/car-cancellation-documents.md) — the
