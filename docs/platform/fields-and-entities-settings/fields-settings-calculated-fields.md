# Calculated Fields and Row Colouring

Sometimes the information a user needs is not stored on the record in front of them. A salesman writing an invoice wants to know what that customer still owes; a storekeeper picking an item wants to know how many are left in the warehouse; a collections clerk wants to know when this customer last bought anything. None of that lives on the document being edited — it lives somewhere else in the database, and today the user has to leave the screen, open a report, and come back.

The two grids on this page close that gap. The first attaches a query to a screen so that the answer appears as an ordinary-looking extra field or column. The second lets a query decide the background colour of a grid row, so that problem records stand out at a glance without anyone reading a single number.

Both grids are applied by the server, so a change takes effect as soon as you save the record — no sign-out, no restart.

## calculated Fields Queries

Every entity in the system carries twenty spare, calculated slots named `sqlField1` through `sqlField20`. They store nothing. Each one is filled by a query that runs when the record is read, and the value is thrown away again when the screen closes. That is precisely what makes them useful: the number is always current, and nobody has to remember to refresh it.

Once a slot has a query behind it, it behaves like any other field. You can place it on the edit screen, show it as a list-view column, and print it on a document layout.

| Column | What it does |
|---|---|
| For Type List | A reusable named list of entity types, so one line covers many screens at once. |
| For Type | A single entity type this line applies to (for example Sales Invoice). |
| Detail Field | Leave empty for the record's own header. Fill it with a grid's field ID (for example `details`) to define the slots for the **rows** of that grid instead, so every line gets its own calculated columns. |
| Field 1 Query … Field 20 Query | The query behind each of the twenty slots. |

::: warning A line with no type does nothing
Unlike most grids on this screen, these lines are **not** generic. A line with both **For Type** and **For Type List** empty is ignored completely. Always name the entity type, or point at a list of types.

### Where the values show up

Saving a query does not, on its own, make anything visible. The query fills the slot; you still have to put the slot on a screen. That is a separate job, done in the Screen Modifier:

- To show it on the edit screen, add the field `sqlField3` (or whichever slot you used) to a page or group — see [Screen Modifier — Edit-Screen Modifications](/platform/screen-modifier/screen-modifier-edit-screen).
- To show it as a column in the record file or in the selector pop-up, add it there — see [Screen Modifier — List View & Selector Pop-up](/platform/screen-modifier/screen-modifier-list-and-search).
- When you used **Detail Field**, add the column to the grid itself, not to the header.

Give the field a sensible title while you are there. `sqlField3` is a meaningful name to you and to nobody else; the user should see "Customer balance".

Sixteen of the slots hold ordinary short text. Slots 17 and 18 hold long text, so use one of those when the answer is a paragraph rather than a number. Slots 19 and 20 hold a **colour code** rather than text — handy when you want a query to drive the colour of one particular cell.

::: info Empty on a brand-new record
The query only runs against a record that has already been saved. On a document the user has just started, the calculated fields stay blank until the first save. This is normal and not a configuration mistake.
:::

### How to write the query

The query is written in SQL, the same language used for [Virtual Entities](/platform/virtual-entity-guide) and report definitions. Only the **first column of the first row** is used — everything else the query returns is discarded. Write the query so that it returns exactly one value.

Anything you put in curly braces is a **placeholder** that the server fills in before the query runs, safely, as a bound parameter:

| Placeholder | What it is replaced with |
|---|---|
| `{code}`, `{valueDate}`, `{remarks}` | A field of the record being read. |
| `{customer.id}`, `{warehouse.code}` | A field reached through a reference on the record. |
| `{id}` | The record's own identifier — useful for excluding the current document from a total. |
| `{$line.item}`, `{$line.satisfiedQty}` | A field of the **current grid row**, when the line has a **Detail Field**. |
| `{loginUserId}`, `{loginUserCode}`, `{loginBranchId}`, `{loginLegalEntityId}`, `{loginLanguage}` | Details of the user who is looking at the record. |

Here is a complete, working example. On a Sales Invoice, show how much this customer has been invoiced altogether, ignoring the invoice currently open:

```sql
select isnull(sum(s.netValue), 0)
from SalesInvoice s
where s.customer_id = {customer.id}
  and s.id <> {id}
```

Put that in **Field 3 Query** on a line whose **For Type** is Sales Invoice and whose **Detail Field** is empty, then add `sqlField3` to the invoice's edit screen with the title "Total invoiced to this customer". Saving the record is enough; the next invoice a user opens shows the number.

::: danger Never write the grid's own name in a row query
When the line has a **Detail Field**, the query must **not** refer to that grid directly. Writing `{details.item}` in a query whose Detail Field is `details` is rejected when you save the record, with a message telling you to use `$line` instead. The current row is always referred to as `{$line.item}`, `{$line.satisfiedQty}`, and so on. Placeholders that do *not* start with `$line` still read the document header, so a row query can mix both: `{$line.item}` for the row and `{valueDate}` for the document's date.
:::

### The cost

::: warning These queries run once per row
A calculated field is evaluated separately for every record and every grid row that is read. On an edit screen that is a handful of executions and nobody notices. On a list view showing two hundred records it is two hundred executions of your query before the screen appears, and on a grid with fifty lines it is fifty more. A query that takes a tenth of a second in a query tool becomes a twenty-second list view.

Keep these queries narrow: one aggregate, filtered on an indexed column, with no joins you can avoid. Test the query on its own and look at how long it takes before you attach it to anything. The system does cap how long one of these may run — see [Performance and Search](/platform/global-config/global-config-performance) — but a query that hits the cap fails the screen rather than quietly returning nothing, so the cap is a safety net, not a solution.
:::

::: warning One line per entity type
The twenty slots belong to the entity type, not to the line. If two lines both name Sales Invoice and both fill **Field 3 Query**, the two queries collide: a critical error is written to the server log and one of them wins, with no way to predict which. Keep a single line per entity type and fill all twenty slots on it. The same applies across records — do not configure Sales Invoice slots in one record and more Sales Invoice slots in another.
:::

::: warning The line's Inactive tick is ignored here
Ticking **Inactive** on an individual line of this grid does **not** switch the query off; it keeps running. To retire a calculated field, clear its query or delete the line. Ticking **Inactive** on the whole record does work — every calculated field and row colour in that record stops immediately.

## Style Overrider Details

Numbers in a grid have to be read. Colour does not. A purchase order whose lines are half received, a claim grid where two rows are past their due date, a lines grid where one item is below its minimum stock — all of these are obvious in a fraction of a second if the row is painted, and invisible if it is not.

This grid attaches a query to a grid, and the query decides the background colour of each of its rows.

| Column | What it does |
|---|---|
| For Type | The entity type whose screen carries the grid (for example Sales Order). |
| Entity List | A reusable named list of entity types, so one line covers several screens. |
| Field | The field ID of the **grid** whose rows are being coloured, for example `details`. **Required** — a line with no field does nothing. |
| Row Background Colour Query | The query that returns the colour for the row. |

The query is written exactly like a calculated field query above: same placeholders, same `{$line.…}` form for the current row, and only the first column of the first row is used. The difference is what it returns — a **colour**, applied directly as the row's background. A hexadecimal code is the usual form:

```sql
select case
         when {$line.satisfiedQty} < {$line.quantity.baseQty.value} then '#FFDDDD'
         else ''
       end
```

Return an empty value for rows that should keep their normal appearance; only rows that come back with a colour are painted. Any colour value the browser understands works, so `red` or `#FFDDDD` are both accepted, but stick to pale shades: the row's text still has to be readable on top of it, and a grid where every second row is a strong colour is harder to read than one with no colour at all.

::: tip Pick colours that survive a photocopy
Colour is a hint, not a record. If "past due" only exists as a pink row, it disappears the moment someone prints the screen in black and white or looks at it with colour-blind eyes. Pair the colour with a calculated field that says the same thing in words, and the information survives.
:::

::: warning Same per-row cost, same conflicts
The colour query runs once per row, exactly like a calculated field, so everything said above about keeping it narrow applies here too. And because the colour query shares the same set of slots, two lines colouring the same grid of the same entity type conflict in the same way — one wins, and a critical error is logged. Keep one line per entity type and grid.
:::

A calculated field line and a row-colour line for the same entity and the same grid do **not** conflict with each other — they occupy different slots and work together happily. It is perfectly normal to have a grid whose rows carry three calculated columns and a colour, all driven from the same screen.

::: info Row colouring is for grids, not for the record file
This grid paints the rows of a grid **inside an edit screen**. It is not the way to colour rows in a record file's list view. If what you want is "show me the overdue invoices", a saved filter on the record file or a dashboard widget is the right tool — see [Quick Filters](/platform/list-views/quick-filters) and the [BI Module](/platform/bi/bi-module-guide).
