# DeleteRelatedEntityAction

**This document was generated using Claude.ai**

## Overview

Deletes related entities that were previously generated by EAGenerateEntityFromEntityAction. Uses SQL queries to find target entities and safely removes them maintaining data integrity.

## When This Action Runs

Manual execution or automated cleanup workflows to remove related entities when source entity changes. Processes single entity deletion based on SQL query results.

## How It Works

1. Executes finder SQL query with parameter substitution (`{fieldName}` placeholders)
2. Loads first matching entity using specified target type
3. Performs business deletion through EntityMediator with validation rules
4. Handles cascade deletions and maintains transaction safety

## Key Parameters

- **Parameter 1:** Target Type (Required) - Entity type name (e.g., "CreditNote", "PaymentVoucher")
- **Parameter 2:** Finder SQL (Required) - SQL query returning ID column of target entities

### SQL Examples:
```sql
-- Delete credit note generated from invoice
SELECT id FROM CreditNote WHERE ref5Id = {id}

-- Delete journal entry from document
SELECT id FROM JournalEntry WHERE fromDoc_id = {id} AND fromDoc_type = '{entityType}'
```

## Database Tables Affected

- **Target Entity Tables** - Complete entity record deleted including collections
- **Audit Logs** - Deletion events recorded
- **Related Entities** - May be affected by cascade rules

## Important Warnings

### ⚠️ Data Loss Risk
- Permanent deletion cannot be easily recovered
- May trigger cascade deletion of related entities
- Only first matching entity is deleted

### ⚠️ Business Logic
- Respects all validation rules and permissions
- Cannot delete entities with dependent records
- Some entities cannot be deleted in certain workflow states
