# Integrations

The Integrations module is where Nama keeps its ready-made links to outside platforms that a
customer is *required* to report to. Today it holds two, both Saudi, and they have nothing in
common beyond sharing a menu:

- **Eltezam** is for government agencies. The Ministry of Civil Service (MCS) expects every agency
  to report its employees — who they are, their jobs, their monthly payslips, qualifications,
  vacations and appraisals — to its Eltezam service, in the ministry's own codes. Nama reads all of
  that from the HR module, translates it through code tables, and sends it one request at a time
  over the Government Service Bus.
- **Alwatania Distributors** is for companies that distribute for Alwatania. Nama pushes the
  distributor's master data — customers, salesmen, items and the places they belong to — and every
  sales invoice and return to Alwatania's platform. It is one-way: Nama sends, and reads back only
  the platform's answer to each request.

Each one has its own licence, its own screens and its own way of being sent, so read only the part
you need. Neither has a Send button: in both, data leaves Nama when an entity flow or a task
schedule runs one of the integration's actions.

The menu has the same shape for both: the configuration screens under **Master Files**, and — for
Eltezam only — the submission document under **Documents**. The root of the menu reads
*integrations* in both languages.

The platform-wide integrations — the Nama ERP API, attendance machines, the invoice retriever,
SFDA drug track and trace and others — are in [External Integrations](/integration/). E-commerce
platforms have their own [e-commerce Integration](/modules/ecommerce/) module.
