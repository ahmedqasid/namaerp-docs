# Field, Page, and List View Security

Basic permissions answer the question "what can the user do with a type?" But you often need finer control: hide the *Cost* column from sales reps, lock the *System Entries* page for data-entry operators, or prevent a role from opening a sensitive list view. That is exactly what these three pages do — and each one lives in **two places**: on the security profile and on the user record, with user-level rows taking precedence over profile rows when their scope overlaps.

## Field Settings

Open the **Field Settings** page inside the security profile (or user) screen.

Each row targets a type (or a type list, or nothing — meaning all types) and a single field:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Type / Type List** | The types this row applies to. Leave both empty to apply to all types. |
| **Field** | The field ID to control. Use `*` as a wildcard to cover *all* fields of the targeted type. |
| **Control Type** | **Normal** — no restriction; **Disabled** — field is visible but read-only; **InVisible** — field is hidden from the screen entirely. |
| **Apply on: New / Edit / Draft** | Three flags that define *when* the restriction takes effect. Enable all three (or leave the default) for it to always apply; or enable *Edit* only so the user can fill the field on creation but cannot change it afterward. |
| **Prevent Insert Row / Prevent Delete Row / Prevent Copy Row** | When the "Field" is a detail grid (such as invoice lines), these columns prevent adding, deleting, or copying rows in that grid — independently of whether existing rows can be edited. |

### How are field rows resolved?

When a screen shows a field, the system looks for the first matching row in this order:

1. User rows first, then security profile rows — the user record wins.
2. Within each group: a row for the exact type, then a row for a type list containing that type, then a row with no type at all.
3. A row naming the specific field takes precedence over a wildcard `*` row at the same level.

If no row matches, the field behaves normally. Users with a full-access security profile bypass field settings entirely.

::: tip Locking data at creation time
The very common requirement — "the Customer field on an invoice must not change after the document is created" — is a single row: target the invoice, field `customer`, Control Type *Disabled*, apply on **Edit** only.

::: warning Field security is a UI barrier, not a vault
Hiding a field removes it from the edit screen. The data itself may still appear in reports, list view columns, or exports — combine field settings with report restrictions and list view security (see *List View Security* below) when the data itself is sensitive.

## Page Security

Type edit screens are organized into pages (tabs). The **Page Security** page lets you remove or freeze entire pages for a role instead of disabling fields one by one.

![Page Security page](../../../platform/security/images/security-profile-page-security.png)

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Type / Type List** | The types this row applies to (at least one is required here — there is no all-types wildcard). |
| **Page Name** | The page identifier — or simply the page *number* as the user sees it (1, 2, 3...). |
| **Control Type** | **Disabled** — page opens read-only; **InVisible** — page is hidden; **Normal** — no restriction explicitly set. |

User-level page rows are checked before profile rows, and a full-access profile bypasses the feature entirely.

## List View Security

A single type may have several list views — and you can add custom ones. Sometimes a list view exposes columns a role should not browse (cost columns, profit margins...). This page allows or blocks specific list views.

![List View Security page](../../../platform/security/images/security-profile-listview-security.png)

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Type / Type List** | The types this row applies to. |
| **List View ID** | The list view identifier. |
| **Allow / Prevent** | Whether the targeted list view is allowed or blocked. |

Resolution follows the usual pattern — user rows first, then profile rows, and the first row that matches the view and type decides. **If nothing matches, the view is allowed**: list view security is an opt-in restriction, so only add rows for the views you care about.

::: info
A full-access security profile cannot contain list view security rows at all — the system rejects that combination on save, because the full-access profile would ignore them anyway.

## Related Settings Worth Knowing

- **Minimum characters to start search** (on basic permission rows) prevents reference lookups from listing large master files — see [Security Profiles](/en/platform/security/security-profiles.md).
- **Maximum records per list page** exists in the security profile header, user settings, and global settings; the most specific value wins.
- To restrict the *rows* visible within an allowed list view, you want Extra Filters — see [Record-Level Security](/en/platform/security/record-level-security.md).
- To limit a user to a specific fiscal year or period in documents and reports, see [Limit User to a Fiscal Year](/en/platform/list-views/limit-user-to-year.md).
