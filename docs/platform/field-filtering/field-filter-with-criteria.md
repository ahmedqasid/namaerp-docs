# Field Filter with Criteria

You can use the **Field Filter with Criteria** screen to apply custom filters when searching within specific fields on any Nama ERP screen.

For example:
- In a **purchase invoice**, you may want to display only items whose default supplier matches the invoice's supplier.
- In a **sales invoice**, you may want to show only **non-service items** when selecting an item.

::: info Not the same screen as Field Filtering
The menu next to this one holds **Field Filtering**, a different screen with a similar name. Field Filtering does not take a condition at all — it only decides whether a lookup is narrowed by the document's branch, legal entity and other dimensions. If the question is "why can't this user pick a warehouse from another branch", read [Field Filtering by Dimension](/platform/field-filtering/field-filtering-by-dimension) instead.

## How to Define a Field Filter with Criteria

1. **Create a Criteria Record**
    - In the [Criteria Definition](/platform/automation-and-rules/criteria-definitions) file, define the condition you want to apply (e.g., non-service items).

2. **Create a Field Filter Record**
    - Open the **Field Filter with Criteria** screen and create a new record.
    - Specify the **Document Type** (e.g., Sales Invoice).
    - Define the **Field** to apply the filter on (e.g., `details.item.item`). It has to be the lookup field itself — the one the user picks in — not the code or name that mirrors it (`details.item.itemCode` and its siblings are filled *from* the lookup, so a filter there never reaches the picker).
    - Assign the previously defined **Criteria** to this field.

3. **Assign the Field Filter**
    - Go to one of the following configuration locations and assign the filter in the **Field Filter** field:
        - Document Type
        - Document Book
        - Master Group
        - a menu entry, on a [Menu Definition or a Menu Update](/platform/menus/menu-structure)
    - Alternatively, select the **Automatic** option to apply it automatically.

4. **Save** your changes.

> If your filter requires dynamic logic such as loops or conditions, use **Tempo Language** instead of a criteria definition.

::: tip A shortcut when the filter should always apply
Steps 2 and 3 above exist so that the same filter can be switched on for one document term or one book and left off elsewhere. When a filter should simply always apply to a field, there is a quicker route: register the criteria straight against the field in the **Extra Filter** grid of [Fields and Entities Settings](/platform/fields-and-entities-settings/fields-settings-reference-lookups). No filter record to name, nothing to assign — the lookup starts obeying the criteria as soon as you save.

## Example: Filter Non-Service Items in Sales Invoice

To show only non-service items when selecting an item in the **Sales Invoice** screen:

1. In the *Criteria Definition* file, define a condition for non-service items.
2. Create a new record in **Field Filter with Criteria**:
    - Document Type: Sales Invoice
    - Field: `details.item.item`
    - Criteria: Your non-service items criteria
3. Save the filter with a name like `NonService`.
4. In your **Sales Invoice document term**, set **Field Filter = NonService**.
5. Create a new Sales Invoice using that term.
6. When selecting items, only non-service items will be shown.

::: tip
- You must assign the filter in **Field Filter** field of a document type, book, master group, or menu update.
- To test your criteria:
    - Enable **Use In List View** in the criteria record.
    - Open the item list and enter your filter in the **Extra Filter** field.
    - The list should show only matching items.
- You can retrieve the **Textual Criteria** from the criteria record to see or manually adjust the filter conditions.
- For advanced logic, use **Tempo Language**.

## Example: Dynamic Filter Using Tempo

Suppose a **Sales Invoice** is based on a **Sales Order** containing multiple customers in the lines. You want to list only the customers with remaining quantities (`unsatisfiedQty2`) when selecting a customer in the sales invoice.

Use this **Tempo** code in the `Dynamic Filter` field of the field filter:

```
{loop(fromDoc.$toReal.details)}
  {if(fromDoc.$toReal.details.unsatisfiedQty2)}
    code,Equal,{fromDoc.$toReal.details.customer.code},OR;
  {endif}
{endloop}
```

## The condition speaks the language of the screen being searched

This is the mistake behind most dynamic filters that return nothing. A filter line has two halves, and they name fields on two different screens:

- the **Field** column names the lookup on *your* document — where the filter applies;
- the condition names fields on the screen the lookup *searches* — the item, the customer, the warehouse.

Suppose a stock count document carries **Reference 1** on its term lines, and you want that lookup to offer only the items already entered in the details. This filter looks right and returns nothing:

```
{loop(details)}
termsLines.ref1,Equal,{details.item.item.code},OR;
{endloop}
```

`termsLines.ref1` belongs in the **Field** column, not in the condition — the item screen being searched has no such field. Write the condition with the item's own fields, and let the Tempo placeholders read your document:

```
{loop(details)}
code,Equal,{details.item.item.code},OR;
{endloop}
```

or, more precisely, by the record's identifier:

```
{loop(details)}
id,Equal,{details.item.item.id},OR;
{endloop}
```

## Example: offer items by available stock

A common request: a stock issue should offer only items that have a balance, and a stock receipt only items that have none.

**Items with a balance, on a stock issue.** The item carries its balances in a `quantities` collection, so the condition can read them directly. Importing this record creates the filter:

::: details JSON for direct import

```json
{
  "forType": "StockIssue",
  "automaticUsage": true,
  "lines": [
    {
      "fieldId": "details.item.item",
      "dynamicFilter": "quantities.data.net,GreaterThan,0,AND;"
    }
  ]
}
```

:::

**Items with no balance, on a stock receipt.** The obvious reverse — `quantities.data.net` less than or equal to zero — does not work. An item that has never moved has **no quantity row at all**, so the condition finds nothing to compare, and those are exactly the items this filter is meant to show. The way around it is to keep the total in a spare numeric field of the item (`n5` here) and filter on that.

First, a [scheduled task](/platform/automation-and-rules/scheduled-tasks) that writes every item's total into `n5` — zero for an item with no rows:

::: details JSON for direct import

```json
{
  "scheduleType": "Action",
  "className": "com.namasoft.infor.domainbase.util.actions.EAExecuteUpdateQuery",
  "title1": "Update Query",
  "parameter1": "update i set n5 = coalesce(qty.net,0) from InvItem i\nouter apply (\nselect sum(q.net) net from ItemDimensionsQty q where q.item_id = i.id\n) qty",
  "title2": "Evict Cache After Execution(true,false)",
  "parameter2": "true",
  "actionDescription": "Execute update query specified in first parameter"
}
```
:::

Then the filter on the receipt:

::: details JSON for direct import

```json
{
  "forType": "StockReceipt",
  "automaticUsage": true,
  "lines": [
    {
      "fieldId": "details.item.item",
      "dynamicFilter": "n5,LessThanOrEqual,0,AND;"
    }
  ]
}
```
:::

`n5` is only as fresh as its last update. To update it the moment stock moves instead of waiting for the task, run the same query from an [entity flow](/platform/entity-flows/) that fires after a stock issue, receipt or transfer is saved and its quantities are processed. The flow below does that for save and delete; its `entityTypeList` is the code of an [Entity Type List](/platform/automation-and-rules/entity-type-lists) holding the three document types, which must exist before you import it.

::: details JSON for direct import
```json
{
  "entityTypeList": "StockIssueReceiptTransfer",
  "runAfterCommitDocAndEffectOnDB": true,
  "waitForQuantityProcessing": true,
  "details": [
    {
      "className": "com.namasoft.infor.domainbase.util.actions.EAExecuteUpdateQuery",
      "parameter1": "update i set n5 =  coalesce(qty.net,0) from InvItem i\nouter apply (\nselect sum(q.net)  net from ItemDimensionsQty q where q.item_id = i.id\n) qty",
      "parameter2": "true",
      "targetAction": "PostCommit"
    },
    {
      "className": "com.namasoft.infor.domainbase.util.actions.EAExecuteUpdateQuery",
      "parameter1": "update i set n5 =  coalesce(qty.net,0) from InvItem i\nouter apply (\nselect sum(q.net)  net from ItemDimensionsQty q where q.item_id = i.id\n) qty",
      "parameter2": "true",
      "targetAction": "PostDelete"
    }
  ]
}
```
:::

Keep the scheduled task as well, running once a day: it catches what the flow never sees, such as large imports and direct edits.
