# Fields and Entities Settings

Every organisation wants the system to behave slightly differently. One wants customer codes that
always start with `CU-`. Another wants the mobile number on the customer screen to be clickable so
the sales team can dial it. A third wants the item lookup on a sales invoice to offer only the items
that are actually for sale, and a fourth wants overdue invoices to show up red in the list.

None of that needs a programmer. It all lives on one screen — **Fields and Entities Settings**,
reached from **Basic → Settings** — where an administrator writes a line describing the behaviour
they want and which field or screen it applies to. The screen carries around forty of these settings
grids, which is why the documentation is split across the pages below rather than crammed into one.

If you are new to this screen, start with the overview: it explains the handful of columns that
appear on nearly every grid, and — just as importantly — when a change you save actually becomes
visible to users.

## Fields on the Screen

How a field looks, what tool the user gets to fill it in, and what the system accepts when they do.

  <LandingCard icon="🎨" title="Field Appearance and Input Widgets" link="/platform/fields-and-entities-settings/fields-settings-field-appearance.md" details="Number masks, colours and text direction, rich-text editors, clickable phone and e-mail fields, signature pads, and scanner buttons." />

## Finding and Naming Records

Everything about the fields that point at other records, and how those records are searched, filtered
and labelled.

  <LandingCard icon="🔎" title="Reference Fields and Lookups" link="/platform/fields-and-entities-settings/fields-settings-reference-lookups.md" details="Which types a lookup offers, extra filters, how a record is labelled, extra searchable columns and codes, search speed, and what happens when nothing matches." />
