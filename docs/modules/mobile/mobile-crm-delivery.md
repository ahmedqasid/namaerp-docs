# Customer Service, Delivery & Receipts

Besides sales and inventory, the app serves the other field teams: the customer-service rep who logs visits, the maintenance technician, the delivery driver, and the collector who issues receipt vouchers at the customer's site.

## Customer visits

The visit screens appear under the **Customer Service** group:

![Customer Service group](../../ar/modules/mobile/images/crm-delivery/customer-service-group.jpg)

When creating a **visit request** the rep logs their visit to the customer: they set the **type** and **state** and add **notes**, and can **attach a file**, capture the **customer signature** and **rep signature**, then **check in** to the visit and later check out. The app captures the visit's time and location.

From the **visit voucher log** the rep follows up their previous visits. The organization can prevent opening a new visit while there is still an open visit that hasn't been closed yet.

::: info Maintenance and questionnaires
For maintenance teams, the app supports following up **maintenance notices and orders**, and logging **maintenance visits** with the spare parts used and the customer and technician signatures. It also supports **questionnaires** to collect customer feedback via ready-made question templates with signature capture.

### Questionnaires

The **Questionnaire** screen lets you choose a questionnaire template and a customer, then fill in the questions and collect the customer and rep signatures before submitting.

## Delivery

The delivery module serves delivery drivers and reps, and its screens appear under the **Shipping** group or the **Delivery module** depending on the configuration:

- **Shipment delivery voucher** — where the driver reviews the items to be delivered, and can confirm **deliver all** or record **failed delivery for all**, or handle each customer individually. It captures the **customer signature** and **rep signature** as proof of delivery, with the ability to print.

- **Delivery orders** — a list that can be filtered by customer number or shipment number to follow up the orders assigned to the driver.

The **Delivery module** gathers the tools a delivery rep needs in one place — electronic receipt, purchase invoice, sales return, the complaints screen, and the orders screen:

::: tip Driver field tools
Depending on the configuration, the driver can filter their tasks by customer, area or branch, share the order details via **WhatsApp**, navigate to the customer's location on the map, and add voice notes.

## Electronic receipts

The collector issues the **electronic receipt voucher** at the customer's site directly. The screen appears under the **Accounts** group:

![Accounts group — electronic receipt](../../ar/modules/mobile/images/crm-delivery/accounts-receipt-group.jpg)

In the receipt voucher the collector chooses the customer, the payment date, the currency and the **payment method** (cash, bank…), and the voucher can include **installments** and **terms and conditions** the customer agrees to. After saving, the receipt can be **printed** to the configured printer. Receipt vouchers are often linked to source documents such as the sales order or sales invoice.

::: warning Linking the method to a bank
The payment methods and banks available in the app are loaded from server settings; if the payment method is a bank method, the corresponding bank must be specified.

## Notes for the administrator

- The visit types and states, the allowed reference fields, and the customer/item criteria are configured from the [Mobile App configuration](./mobile-application-guide.md).
- The receipt and delivery voucher books, the payment methods and banks, and the print templates for receipts and the terms and conditions are defined on the server side.
- The visits, maintenance, delivery and receipt modules appear in the menu only if they are licensed for your organization.
