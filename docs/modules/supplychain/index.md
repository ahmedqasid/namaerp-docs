# Supply Chain Management

Welcome to the Supply Chain Management module - the heart of how NaMa ERP helps you track, manage, and control the flow of goods through your organization.

## What This Module Does

Think of the Supply Chain module as the central nervous system for everything related to inventory, purchasing, and sales in your business. Whether you're receiving raw materials from suppliers, manufacturing products, selling to customers, or simply moving items between warehouses, this module orchestrates all these activities and ensures everything is properly tracked and accounted for.

## The Big Picture

Let's start with a simple story to understand how everything fits together.

Imagine you run a manufacturing company that makes furniture. Your journey with the Supply Chain module begins when you realize you need wood to make tables. You create a **purchase request** for wood, get **quotations** from suppliers, place a **purchase order**, and when the wood arrives, you create a **receipt document** that brings the wood into your inventory and updates your accounting books automatically.

Now you're ready to make tables. You **issue** the wood to your production department (which reduces your raw materials inventory), and when the tables are ready, you **receive** them back as finished products (which increases your finished goods inventory). The costs of the wood automatically flow into the value of your tables.

When a customer places an order, you create a **sales quotation**, convert it to a **sales order**, then issue a **sales invoice** that records the sale in accounting and issues the table from your warehouse at the same time. The system tracks every step, makes sure you have enough quantity, and helps you reserve items for specific customers.

Throughout this journey, the system does much more than just track numbers; it:
- Makes sure you don't sell what you don't own
- Calculates costs and profits automatically
- Creates accounting entries so your books are always up to date
- Tracks serial numbers and batch numbers when needed
- Manages multiple warehouses and locations
- Handles returns, replacements, and quality control
- Supports multiple units of measure (selling by piece, buying by carton)
- And much more...

## How Documents Work in NaMa ERP

::: tip Understanding Document States
Unlike some systems that require "posting" documents, NaMa ERP works differently:

**Draft Mode**: Create and edit documents with no effect on inventory or accounting. Perfect for preparation and review.

**Saved**: Once a document is saved (out of draft mode), it **immediately** affects:
- Inventory quantities
- Accounting balances
- Customer and supplier accounts
- Available stock calculations

**Edits**: Any changes you make to saved documents appear in the system immediately, with no separate "post" or "confirm" step needed.
:::

This immediate approach means:
- Real-time inventory accuracy
- Up-to-date accounting at all times
- No delays from periodic posting
- Instant visibility of changes

But it also means you need to be careful - once saved (out of draft), a document has a real effect!

## How This Guide Is Organized

The Supply Chain module is large, so we've split it into related groups that follow the way the system organizes itself into sub-modules. You don't have to read them in order; jump to whatever serves your current task.

### Foundations

Before you buy, sell, or store anything, you need to define **what** you deal in and **where** you keep it.

### Setting the Rules

Everything above behaves the way two settings files tell it to. When the system does something you did not expect — a cost calculated differently, a quantity refused, a price picked from the wrong list — the answer is almost always in one of these.

### Development Request Notes

Some client requests change how a core part of the module behaves in ways worth explaining on their own. The **[Development Request Notes](./development-requests/)** section keeps the story behind those changes — the business problem, what the feature does, and when to enable it.

## A Note About Document Types

As you read this documentation, you'll encounter many "document" types like PurchaseInvoice, StockReceipt, SalesOrder, and others. Don't let that confuse you!

Think of them as different kinds of forms you fill out to record different business events. Just like in a paper system where you have a "purchase order form" and a "goods receipt note," the system has different document types for different purposes.

Each document type is designed for a specific business transaction and contains exactly the fields and features appropriate to it. But they all follow similar patterns, so once you understand a few, the rest become intuitive.

## Integration with Other Modules

The Supply Chain module doesn't work in isolation; it's deeply integrated with:

**Accounting**: Every inventory transaction creates accounting entries automatically. When you receive purchases, the inventory asset rises and payables rise. When you sell, revenue rises and inventory falls. No need to think about it - it happens on its own.

**Manufacturing**: When you issue raw materials to production and receive finished products, the system tracks costs and ensures materials are available for production orders.

**CRM**: Sales quotations and orders can originate from CRM opportunities, and customer service cases can trigger returns and replacements.

**Fixed Assets**: Some items you buy become fixed assets rather than inventory. The system handles this distinction automatically.

**Hospital Management**: Pharmacies, blood banks, and medical supplies have special requirements that the system handles in a built-in way.

## Let's Get Started

Ready to dive in? Start with [Understanding Inventory Items](./understanding-items.md) to build your foundation, or jump straight to the section that matches what you're trying to accomplish right now.

Remember: this documentation focuses on helping you understand **how** and **why** the system works the way it does, not just listing features. If you're looking for a specific field or technical detail, those references live elsewhere. Here, we tell the story of your supply chain.
