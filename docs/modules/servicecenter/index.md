# Service Center

Nama Service Center is built for the motor trade. It covers the workshop that repairs cars, the showroom that sells them, the insurance and financing paperwork that goes with a sale, a small vehicle-rental register, and the ticket queue at the reception desk.

It helps to know from the start that these are **four largely independent products that share one menu**, not one system that follows a car from cradle to grave. The workshop keeps its own vehicle file; the showroom keeps its own car record with the chassis and engine numbers. A car sold through the showroom does not automatically appear as a serviceable vehicle in the workshop, and the two records are not joined. Read the overview before anything else — it explains the split, the two menu roots, and which of the six licences unlocks what.

The second thing worth knowing early is that **almost nothing here works out of the box**. Every screen in the module is licence-gated, and the car-tracking half needs a feature switch, per-item setup and a screen change before you can even type a chassis number. The getting-started page walks through that in the order that avoids dead ends.

## Start Here

The map of the module, the settings, and the order to set a fresh database up in.
