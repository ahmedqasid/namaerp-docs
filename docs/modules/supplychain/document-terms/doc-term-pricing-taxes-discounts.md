# Pricing, Taxes & Discounts Configuration

This tab controls how unit prices, discounts, and taxes are calculated on documents created under the term — whether they are forced from price lists, recalculated on save, locked after a from-document, or excluded from item cost. The options apply to both sales and purchase documents; many are restricted to one side or to a single document type, as noted on each option.

## Taxes

Tax basics surface for any taxable `IInvoice` document (sales and purchase) and require the **Sales Tax** feature to be enabled.

**Taxable** `termConfig.taxable` — Marks documents created under this term as subject to tax, enabling tax calculation on the document. When off, no tax is computed.

**Tax Plan** `termConfig.taxPlan` — Selects the tax plan (the set of tax rules and rates) applied to documents of this term.

**Modifiable Tax** `termConfig.modifiableTax` — Allows the user to manually edit the computed tax value on the document instead of using only the auto-calculated tax.

**Allow Editing Header Tax In Details** `termConfig.allowEditingHdrTaxInDetails` — Permits editing the header (invoice-level) tax from within the detail lines.

**Editable Taxes** `termConfig.editableTaxes` — Allows the taxes to be edited manually. Defined on additional-cost / expense-style documents (receipt additional cost, LC expense, job-order expense) rather than the main sales/purchase invoice terms.

## Purchase Prices & Order Lock

These options live in the purchase **prices** group and govern how prices, discounts, and payments carried from a source purchase order behave on the purchase invoice. The lock family below applies to **Purchase Invoice / SI Purchase Invoice** only and each flag freezes one value copied from the source purchase order.

| Option | Field ID |
|---|---|
| Prevent Order Price Update | `termConfig.preventOrderPriceUpdate` |
| Prevent Order Total Discount Update | `termConfig.preventOrderTotalDiscountUpdate` |
| Prevent Order Discount Update | `termConfig.preventOrderDiscountUpdate` |
| Prevent Order First Discount Update | `termConfig.preventOrderFirstDiscountUpdate` |
| Prevent Order Second Discount Update | `termConfig.preventOrderSecondDiscountUpdate` |

**Disable After Use** `termConfig.disableAfterUse` — Once the order/document has been consumed by a downstream document, it is locked from further editing. Applies to Contracting Purchase Order, Purchase Order, Proforma Purchase Invoice, SI Purchase Order, and SI Purchase Invoice.

**Copy Remaining To Cash** `termConfig.copyRemainingToCash` — Copies the remaining (unpaid) amount into the cash-paid field, settling the document as paid in cash. Available on both purchase and sales documents.

**Payment Date Not Required** `termConfig.paymentDateNotRequired` — Makes the payment-line date optional, so payment lines can be saved without a payment date. Available on both purchase and sales documents.

**Run Auto Sales Pricing With Save** `termConfig.runAutoSalesPricingWithSaving` — Triggers the automatic sales-pricing routine (recomputing item sale prices) whenever a purchase document of this term is saved. Purchase documents only.

## Vendor Price Strategy

These sub-fields of the price strategy (ids `termConfig.priceStrategy.<x>`) govern how purchase prices and vendor discounts are sourced and re-applied. They appear in the purchase **prices** group.

**Force Price List** `termConfig.priceStrategy.forcePriceList` — Forces purchase prices to come from the price list, preventing free-typed prices that deviate from the configured list.

**Do Not Check Items Without Price List** `termConfig.priceStrategy.doNotCheckItemsWithoutPriceList` — When Force Price List is on, allows saving even if some items have no price-list entry (skips the "item has no price" block).

**Apply Discounts** `termConfig.priceStrategy.useVendorDiscounts` — Applies the configured vendor/supplier discounts when pricing the purchase document. On by default.

**Reapply Price List on Save** `termConfig.priceStrategy.usePriceList` — Re-applies the price list to the document on each save, re-fetching prices from the list. On by default.

Each flag below suppresses one vendor discount slot (1–8) so that specific discount tier is not applied during purchase pricing:

| Option | Field ID |
|---|---|
| Do Not Use Vendor Discount 1 | `termConfig.priceStrategy.doNotUseVendorDiscount1` |
| Do Not Use Vendor Discount 2 | `termConfig.priceStrategy.doNotUseVendorDiscount2` |
| Do Not Use Vendor Discount 3 | `termConfig.priceStrategy.doNotUseVendorDiscount3` |
| Do Not Use Vendor Discount 4 | `termConfig.priceStrategy.doNotUseVendorDiscount4` |
| Do Not Use Vendor Discount 5 | `termConfig.priceStrategy.doNotUseVendorDiscount5` |
| Do Not Use Vendor Discount 6 | `termConfig.priceStrategy.doNotUseVendorDiscount6` |
| Do Not Use Vendor Discount 7 | `termConfig.priceStrategy.doNotUseVendorDiscount7` |
| Do Not Use Vendor Discount 8 | `termConfig.priceStrategy.doNotUseVendorDiscount8` |

## Excluding Taxes & Discounts from Cost

These flags live in the purchase **taxAndDiscounts** group and control whether a given tax or discount is included in the computed **item cost**. They apply to purchase documents only.

Each flag below excludes the corresponding tax (1–4) from the computed item cost, so that tax is not capitalized into inventory cost:

| Option | Field ID |
|---|---|
| Exclude Tax 1 From Cost | `termConfig.excludeTax1` |
| Exclude Tax 2 From Cost | `termConfig.excludeTax2` |
| Exclude Tax 3 From Cost | `termConfig.excludeTax3` |
| Exclude Tax 4 From Cost | `termConfig.excludeTax4` |

Each flag below excludes the corresponding discount (1–8) from the item-cost calculation (the discount is not deducted from cost):

| Option | Field ID |
|---|---|
| Exclude Discount 1 From Cost | `termConfig.excludeDiscount1` |
| Exclude Discount 2 From Cost | `termConfig.excludeDiscount2` |
| Exclude Discount 3 From Cost | `termConfig.excludeDiscount3` |
| Exclude Discount 4 From Cost | `termConfig.excludeDiscount4` |
| Exclude Discount 5 From Cost | `termConfig.excludeDiscount5` |
| Exclude Discount 6 From Cost | `termConfig.excludeDiscount6` |
| Exclude Discount 7 From Cost | `termConfig.excludeDiscount7` |
| Exclude Discount 8 From Cost | `termConfig.excludeDiscount8` |

**Exclude Header Discount From Cost** `termConfig.excludeHeaderDiscount` — Excludes the header (invoice-level) discount from the item-cost calculation.

## Sales Pricing

This block is added only for **Sales** documents. It governs how sale prices are forced from price lists, how offers and free items are applied, minimum-quantity checks, coupons, and reward points.

**Invoice Type** `termConfig.invoiceType` — Classifies the sales document (invoice type), influencing downstream pricing and accounting treatment.

**Force Price List** `termConfig.forcePriceList` — Forces sale prices to be taken from the price list and blocks deviating manual prices.

**Do Not Check Header Discount While Force Price List** `termConfig.doNotCheckDiscountsWhileForcePriceList` — When Force Price List is active, skips validation of the header discount against the price list.

**Price List Default Price** `termConfig.priceListDefaultPrice` — Chooses which price-list price tier (e.g. default/min/max) is used as the default when pricing lines.

**Ignore Force Price List With Free Item** `termConfig.ignoreForcePriceListWithFreeItem` — Skips the Force-Price-List check for free items, so giveaway lines are not rejected for having no list price.

**Do Not Check Items Without Price List** `termConfig.doNotCheckItemsWithoutPriceList` — With Force Price List on, allows saving even if some sale items have no price-list entry.

**Do Not Force Price List When There is Sales Doc In From Doc** `termConfig.doNotForcePriceListWhenThereSalesDocInFromDoc` — Disables Force Price List when the from-document chain already contains a sales document, keeping the prices carried from the prior sales doc.

**Ignore Current Price When Calculating Prices** `termConfig.ignoreCurrentPriceWhenCalculatingPrices` — Ignores the line's existing/current price during recalculation, recomputing prices from scratch.

**Consider Discount Offers For Employee Discount Percentage Validation** `termConfig.considerDiscountOffersForEmpDiscountPercentageValidation` — Includes discount offers when validating the maximum discount percentage an employee may grant — an alternative to using Force Price List.

**Calculate Invoice Discount From Offer With Save** `termConfig.calcDiscountFromOfferWithSave` — Recomputes the invoice discount from active offers every time the document is saved.

**Apply Free Items On Invoice With Save** `termConfig.applyFreeItemsOnInvoiceWithSave` — Applies free-item offers to the invoice value automatically on save.

**Force Item Prices From Units** `termConfig.forceItemPricesFromUnits` — Forces the sale price to come from the item's unit-of-measure table prices.

**Prevent Sales If Quantity Less Than UOM Min Quantity** `termConfig.preventSalesIfQtyLessThanUOMMinQty` — Blocks saving when a line quantity is below the item's minimum sale quantity defined in the unit table.

**Consider Total Qty In Doc For Prevent Sales Less Than Min Qty** `termConfig.considerTotalQtyInDocForPreventSalesLessThanMinQty` — When applying the min-quantity check, sums the item's total quantity across the whole document rather than evaluating each line separately.

**Do Not Consider Current Discount Values When Recalculating** `termConfig.doNotConsiderCurrentDiscountValuesWhenRecalculating` — Ignores existing line discount values when re-running the price/discount recalculation.

**Stop Items Count Offers If From Document Not Empty** `termConfig.stopItemsCountOffersIfFromDocNotEmpty` — Disables item-count-based free-item offers when the document was built from a from-document.

**Stop Items Count Offers With Save** `termConfig.stopItemsCountOffersWithSave` — Disables item-count-based free-item offers from being (re)applied on save.

**Update Lines Discounts From Offers With Save** `termConfig.updateLinesDiscsFromOffersWithSave` — Refreshes line-level discounts from active offers on every save.

**Recalculate Discounts With Invoice Classifications** `termConfig.recalculateDiscountsWithInvoiceClassifications` — Recomputes discounts when an invoice classification is selected or changed.

**Discount Coupon Group** `termConfig.discountCouponGroup` — Restricts which discount-coupon group applies to documents of this term.

**Discount Coupon Book** `termConfig.discountCouponBook` — Selects the discount-coupon book whose coupons can be redeemed on these documents.

**Reward Points Configuration** `termConfig.rewardPointsConfig` — Links the reward/loyalty-points configuration applied when these sales documents are saved.

**Use Pick List** `termConfig.usePickList` — Enables pick-list (stock pulling) rules for the sales invoice. Sales Invoice only.

## Price-Update Control

These options are added to the From-Document group for any `IInvoice` document (sales and purchase). They decide when automatic price recalculation runs, which suggested price is offered, and whether prices freeze after a from-document, term change, or value-date change.

**Do Not Update Prices At All** `termConfig.doNotUpdatePricesAtAll` — Completely disables automatic price recalculation for the document; prices remain as entered.

**Do Not Calculate Prices, Discounts, and Free Items If Unit Price Exists** `termConfig.doNotCalcPricesIfUnitPriceExist` — Skips price/discount/free-item calculation for any line that already has a unit price.

**Ignore "Do Not Calculate Prices If Unit Price Exists" Before First Save** `termConfig.ignoreDoNotCalcPricesIfUnitPriceExistBeforeFirstSave` — Suspends the above flag until the document's first save, so initial pricing still runs.

**Do Not Automatically Add Unit Price** `termConfig.doNotAddUnitPriceAuto` — Prevents the unit price from being auto-filled when an item is selected; the user must enter it.

**Suggest Minimum Price** `termConfig.suggestMinPrice` — Suggests the item's minimum price as the line price.

**Suggest Default Price** `termConfig.suggestDefaultPrice` — Suggests the item's default price as the line price.

**Suggest Maximum Price** `termConfig.suggestMaxPrice` — Suggests the item's maximum price as the line price.

The flags below freeze prices after specific events so they are not recalculated:

## Installments

These options govern installment scheduling on `IInvoice` documents and the broader from-document set.

**Paid in Installments** `termConfig.paidInInstallments` — Marks documents under this term as paid via an installment schedule, enabling installment lines.

**Pay Installments In Order** `termConfig.payInstallmentsInOrder` — Forces installments to be paid in their defined sequence (earliest first).

**Do Not Copy Installments Lines Of From Doc** `termConfig.doNotCopyInstallmentsLinesOfFromDoc` — Prevents installment lines from being copied when building the document from a from-document.

**Allow Payment More Than Invoice Amount** `termConfig.allowPaymentMoreThanInvoiceAmount` — Permits recording payment amounts that exceed the invoice total (overpayment).
