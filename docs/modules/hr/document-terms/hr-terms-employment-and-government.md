# Employment and Government Relations Document Terms

These are the documents that change **who somebody is** rather than what they are paid: the offer
that hires them, the update that changes their salary or their department, the relocation, the
termination, and — in the Gulf countries — the residence, sponsorship and visa paperwork that keeps
them legally employed.

Almost none of them post. Their terms are about what else gets created and what the document is
allowed to change.

The shared mechanics — what a term is, why most aggregated terms only name a book and a term, and
the three differently-named accounting switches — are on
[Salary and Dues Document Terms](/modules/hr/document-terms/hr-terms-salary-and-dues#How-HR-document-terms-work).

## Job offers

**The Job Offer term** has exactly one field, and it answers a question every implementation hits:
*Do Not Change Hiring Date Of Employee* `termConfig.doNotChangeHiringDateOfEmployee`. Normally
accepting a job offer sets the employee's hiring date to the offer's date. Tick this and the hiring
date is left alone — which is what you want when the offer is a re-issue, a correction, or a
formality for somebody who has been working for months.

**The Candidate Job Offer term** repeats that option and adds the pair that makes it an aggregated
document: *Generated Job Offer Book* and *Generated Job Offer Term* (`termConfig.genJobOfferBook`,
`termConfig.genJobOfferTerm`) — the book and term of the job offers created from candidates.

Recruitment is on [Job Offers and Tests](/modules/hr/recruitment/job-offers-and-tests).

## Updating employee information

The employee update document is how almost every change to an employee is recorded — a raise, a
transfer, a new job position, a change of vacation entitlement. Its term has three fields, and two
of them are about provisions.

| Option | Field | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Employee Provision Book** | `termConfig.employeeProvisionBook` | The book of the provisions recalculation document the update creates. |
| **Employee Provision Term** | `termConfig.employeeProvisionTerm` | Its term. |
| **Copy Boolean Fields To Employee** | `termConfig.copyBooleanFieldsToEmployee` | The yes/no fields on the update document are copied onto the employee master file, not only the values and references. The shipped Arabic label keeps the English word *Boolean*. |

The provisions pair matters more than it looks. A raise changes what the end-of-service provision
should be, so the update document triggers a recalculation — but only if it knows which book and
term to create it under. An empty pair here is a common cause of provisions that quietly stop
tracking salary changes.

**The aggregated update term** names *update Employee Info Book* and *Update Employee Info Term* for
the individual documents, and adds two tolerances: *Allow Empty Employee In Components*
`termConfig.allowEmptyEmployeeInComponents` and *Allow Empty Employee In Vacations*
`termConfig.allowEmptyEmployeeInVacations`. Both let a batch carry component or vacation rows that
name no employee, which is how a template row is applied to everybody the batch collects instead of
being repeated per person.

## Relocation and termination

**The Employee Relocate term** carries a single *Without Accounting Effect*
`termConfig.withoutAccountingEffect`, for implementations where a relocation does post something —
a relocation allowance, typically — and others where it does not.

**The firing terms** — both the aggregated firing document and the aggregated firing request — share
one field inherited from a common shape: *Generated Firing Document Book*
`termConfig.generatedFiringBook`. Neither adds anything of its own. A firing request that is
approved becomes a firing document, and this is the book that document lands in.

What the termination actually pays is not here: it is on the dues liquidation term, covered in
[Salary and Dues Document Terms](/modules/hr/document-terms/hr-terms-salary-and-dues).

## The definition letter term

A definition letter («خطاب تعريف») is the letter an employee asks for to show a bank or an embassy:
it confirms that they work here and what they earn. Its term decides **what the letter is allowed to
disclose and to whom**.

**Seven component slots.** *component Type 1* through *component Type 7*
(`termConfig.componentType1` … `termConfig.componentType7`) name which salary components appear in
the letter. This is the whole point of having more than one definition letter term: a letter for a
bank might show basic salary and housing allowance, and a letter for a visa application might show
the full package.

**Seven employee states.** *Employee State* and *Employee State1* through *Employee State6*
(`termConfig.employeeState` … `termConfig.employeeState6`) list the states an employee may be in for
this letter to be issued at all — so a letter can be refused to someone suspended or already
terminated.

**Allow Definition Letter Regardless Of Employee State** `termConfig.allowRegardlessOfEmpState`
turns that whole check off in one tick, for the term used to write a letter for a former employee.

See [Definition Letters](/modules/hr/government-relations/government-relations-overview).

## The Gulf government-relations terms

Three aggregated documents drive the government paperwork, and all three are the two-field shape —
the book and term of the individual requests the batch creates:

| Term | Fields |
|---|---|
| **Aggregated Residence Renewal Request** | *Residence Request Book* `termConfig.residenceReqBook`, *Residence Request Term* `termConfig.residenceReqTerm` |
| **Aggregated Sponsorship Transfer Document** | *Generated Sponsorship Transfer Document Book* and *… Term* |
| **Aggregated Exit / Re-Entry Visa Request** | *Exit ReEntry Visa Book* `termConfig.hoExitReEntryVisaBook`, *Exit ReEntry Visa Term* `termConfig.hoExitReEntryVisaTerm` |

The residence renewal term adds one thing the others do not: an **Excluded Nationalities** grid
`termConfig.excludedNationalities`. Employees of the listed nationalities are skipped by the batch —
which is how a renewal run leaves out nationals of the country itself, or any group whose residence
is handled outside the system.

Government relations are on
[Government Relations Overview](/modules/hr/government-relations/government-relations-overview),
[Residence Renewal](/modules/hr/government-relations/residence-renewal) and
[Social Insurance and Sponsorship](/modules/hr/government-relations/social-insurance-and-sponsorship).
