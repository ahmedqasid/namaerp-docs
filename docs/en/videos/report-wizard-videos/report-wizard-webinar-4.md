## 00:00:01 - Introduction and Overview of the Sales Invoice Report

- The video began with an apology for the delay in starting the recording.
- Creating a sales invoice report was explained, containing:
  - Total number of lines at the top.
  - The code field and actual date of the invoice.
  - The customer field repeated twice (code and name) to display the name and net amount at the end.
- A parameter (input) was created for the invoice date so that it falls between two values, asking the user for "from date" and "to date".
- When the values are entered (e.g., from the 23rd until today), the report appears in the same window, displaying the data in the required format such as customer code, name, code again, name, and so on.

## 00:01:50 - Linking the Customer Code to an Account Statement Report Hyperlink

- Explanation of how to convert the customer code into a Hyperlink to an account statement report.
- Using "Open Hyperlink Expression" to select the appropriate report.
- Selecting the system account statement report (number 32 in the system).
- Setting the report parameters (such as start and end date, liability type: customer).
- Copying the code and saving the report to preserve the changes.
- When run, the report appears linked to the customer, with filtering by dates and liability type.
- Testing by clicking on customer number 6, which correctly displayed the closing balance data.

## 00:06:12 - Merge Headers

- Explanation of the merge column headers feature to use a shared header (e.g., "Customer" with "Code" and "Name" underneath).
- Using `mergeArabicTitle` and `mergeEnglishTitle` fields to set the upper headers.
- Clarifying the importance of not leaving headers duplicated because it looks illogical (e.g., Customer Customer Customer).
- An example of merging two columns such as "Invoice Data" covering "Code" and "Actual Date", with a note that the merge should be between adjacent columns without any separating columns.

## 00:08:08 - Details of Using the Hyperlink Feature and Parameters

- A full display of the hyperlink expression text to clarify all link details and parameters.
- Emphasis on the importance of including all related logical parameters for the report (e.g., you cannot create an account statement link without the customer identifier).
- The ability to select additional parameters depending on the nature of the report, such as accounts and time schedules.
- General instructions on how to think about how the link will appear based on the entered parameters.

## 00:09:53 - Conditional Styling

- Defining conditional styling and its situation with programs that work similarly (such as Jasper).
- Creating new Styles including:
  - Default.
  - Red.
  - Yellow.
  - Green.
- Applying these styles to fields based on a specific value such as the "Net" field value.
- The conditions that were set up:
  - Less than or equal to 100 takes the yellow color (by default no color).
  - Greater than 100 and less than or equal to 500 takes the red color.
  - Greater than 1000 takes the green color.
- The explanation that the first matching condition will be applied and subsequent conditions will not be tested (order of conditions matters).
- Other fields such as date can have separate conditions applied to them.

## 00:15:14 - Applying Conditional Styling Inside the Report

- Explaining how to link custom conditional styles to different fields.
- A reminder that a Static Style or a Conditional Style can be applied.
- Testing and adjusting the conditions to see their results on the report.
- It was noted that the entire customer report in red did not change until the first condition was modified.
- Emphasis on the sensitivity of condition order because the first matching condition is applied immediately and stops.

## General Notes

> **Tip**: When working with reports and formatting inside the system, focus on the order of conditions in conditional styling and do not forget to set important parameters such as customer and dates to ensure links work correctly.

> **Technical note**: Merging columns (Merge Headers) must be done on adjacent columns only; skipping non-adjacent columns is not allowed.

## Conditional Styling Code Examples

```json
[
  {
    "condition": "value <= 100",
    "style": "default"
  },
  {
    "condition": "value > 100 && value <= 500",
    "style": "red"
  },
  {
    "condition": "value > 1000",
    "style": "green"
  }
]
```

## Simplified Hyperlink Expression Example

```text
OpenHyperlink(
  ReportName = "Account Statement",
  Parameters = {
    "fromDate": [ParameterFromDate],
    "toDate": [ParameterToDate],
    "customerType": "Customer",
    "customerCode": [FieldCustomerCode]
  }
