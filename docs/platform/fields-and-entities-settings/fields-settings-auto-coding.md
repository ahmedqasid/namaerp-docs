# Automatic Coding of Master Files

Master files need codes. Customers, items, suppliers, warehouses, employees — every one of them
carries a code, and every code is supposed to follow a convention that somebody in the company
decided years ago. In practice, if the person creating the record types the code by hand, the
convention lasts about a month: one user writes `CUST-001`, the next writes `cust 2`, and a third
reuses a code that was already taken.

The **Files Auto Coding** grid takes the pen out of the user's hand. You describe the code once, as
a formula, and the system builds it when the record is saved — so a customer opened in the Riyadh
branch in 2026 comes out as `RYD-2026-00147` every time, without anybody having to remember the
rule. The same grid can build the Arabic and English names and the alternative code from the same
kind of formula.

On the **Main** tab the grid is headed **Automatic Coding**; its own list and search screen is
called **Files Auto Coding**.

## What this grid does not cover

This is coding for **master files** only. Documents — sales invoices, stock issues, receipt
vouchers — do not get their numbers from here. Document numbering belongs to document books, which
decide the prefix, the serial and the reset period per document type. See
[Document Books](/platform/document-books) for that side of the system.

If you put a document type in **For Type** here, the line is simply never reached.

## Choosing the line that runs

A line first says **which records it is for**, then says **how their code is built**. The scope
columns are the familiar ones described on the
[overview page](/platform/fields-and-entities-settings/fields-settings-overview), plus four
condition columns of its own.

| Column | What it does |
|---|---|
| For Type | The single entity type the line codes, e.g. Customer or Warehouse. |
| Entity List | A reusable named list of entity types, so one line can cover several files at once. |
| Criteria Definition | A saved criteria record; the line only runs when the record being saved matches it. |
| Reversed Criteria Definition | The opposite: the line is skipped when the record matches this criteria. |
| Apply When Query | A query; the line only runs when the query returns a result for the record being saved. |
| Do Not Apply When Query | The opposite: the line is skipped when this query returns a result. |
| Inactive | Switches this single line off without deleting it. |

Matching is by **entity type**. When a master file is saved, the system looks for lines whose
**For Type** or **Entity List** names that type. A line with **no For Type and no Entity List** is
the system-wide default — it is used for any master file that no more specific line claims.

::: warning Only the first matching line for an entity type is ever used
The system picks the **first** line found for the entity type and works with that one alone. If its
criteria do not match the record, the record simply gets **no automatic code** — the system does
not move on and try the next line.

So a set of alternative lines for the same type — one per branch, one per category — does not
behave the way it reads. The second and later lines are never reached. Build the alternatives into
a **single formula** (the formula can read the branch or the category straight off the record), or
into the criteria of the one line that runs.
:::

The four condition columns are cumulative and each one works on its own: a line runs only if
**every** condition you filled in is satisfied. Leave them all empty and the line always runs for
its entity type. Use the criteria columns for rules you can express against the record's own fields,
and the query columns when the decision depends on something the record does not carry — how many
records the branch already has, whether the customer exists in another system.

::: tip Keep one entity type in one record
Because only the first matching line wins and the order across several **Fields and Entities
Settings** records is not something you control, splitting the coding of the same entity type over
two records makes the winner unpredictable. Keep all the coding lines for one file in one record.
:::

## The formula columns

The rest of the line is one block of seventeen formula and numbering columns. You rarely fill more
than three or four of them.

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Code Calculation Formula | Builds the record's code — the fixed part, before the running number. |
| Code Validity Query (Skip code if 1 is returned, and calculate next) | A query that inspects the code just produced and rejects it, so the next number is tried. |
| Name1 Calculation Formula | Builds the Arabic name. |
| Name2 Calculation Formula | Builds the English name. |
| Alternate Code Formula | Builds the alternative code, on files that have one. |
| Revision Code Calculation Formula | Builds the code of an item's revision records. |
| Size And Color Code Calculation Formula | Builds the code of an item's size-and-colour records. |
| Name 1 Encoding Formula For Colour And Size | The Arabic name of a size-and-colour record. |
| Name 2 Encoding Formula For Colour And Size | The English name of a size-and-colour record. |
| Name 1 Encoding Formula For Revision | The Arabic name of a revision record. |
| Name 2 Encoding Formula For Revision | The English name of a revision record. |
| Code Sequence Prefix | Identifies **which running counter** the next number is drawn from. |
| Code Suffix Length | How many digits the running number is padded to. |
| Suffix First Number | The number the counter starts from. |
| Do Not Reset Code With Update | Keeps the existing code instead of recalculating it when the record is edited. |
| Update Revision If Empty Only | Fills a revision code only when it has been left blank. |
| Update Color and Size If Empty Only | Fills a size/colour code only when it has been left blank. |

The five revision and size-and-colour columns exist because an **item** is not one record: it can
carry revision variants and size-and-colour variants, and each variant needs its own code and its
own pair of names. On every other master file those five columns have nothing to act on — see
[Items have their own coding setup](#Items-have-their-own-coding-setup) below.

::: tip Not every column is on screen
The grid ships with the most-used columns visible. If the one you need — **Suffix First Number**,
say, or **Do Not Reset Code With Update** — is not among them, add it to the grid with the
[Screen Modifier](/platform/screen-modifier/screen-modifier-edit-screen).
:::

## Writing a formula

Every formula column understands the same language, and the language is chosen automatically by
what you type.

### The Tempo template language

If the formula contains no `${`, the whole text is treated as a **Tempo** template: plain text with
`{ }` placeholders that read fields off the record being saved.

```
ITM-{category1.code}-
```

Because it is real Tempo, the full manual applies — dotted paths through references, text and date
helpers, conditions:

| You want | You write |
|---|---|
| A field of the record | `{name1}` |
| A field of a referenced record | `{branch.code}`, `{group.code}`, `{category1.name2}` |
| The year the record was created | `{creationDate.$format."yyyy"}` |
| The code of the user who created the record | `{$user.code}` |
| The first characters of a field | `{left(name2, 3)}` |
| A literal curly bracket | `\{` |

The [Tempo Language Manual](/admin/tempo) documents the whole syntax; anything it lists for
notification and print templates works here too, as long as the result is a sensible code.

### The simple `${ }` substitution

If the formula contains `${` anywhere, the system switches to a much simpler mode: each
`${field}` is replaced by that field's value, and nothing else is interpreted.

```
${branch.code}-${category1.code}-
```

| Placeholder | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `${code}`, `${name1}`, `${name2}` | A field of the record being saved. |
| `${branch.code}`, `${group.code}`, `${category1.code}` | A field reached through a reference — any dotted path the record supports. |

Three behaviours are worth knowing in this mode:

- A value whose text starts with `#` is treated as blank.
- Double spaces in the result are collapsed to a single space.
- A **mis-spelled field name does not raise an error** — it is substituted with `@error@` followed
  by the name you typed. If the first record you create comes out with a code like
  `@error@brnch.code@-00001`, that is a typo in the formula, not a system fault.

::: tip Which mode should I use?
Use Tempo. The `${ }` mode has no functions, no formatting and no conditions, and it hides
mistakes instead of reporting them. It exists for older configurations. The only thing to remember
is that the two cannot be mixed: the moment `${` appears anywhere in the text, the whole formula is
read in the simple mode and your `{ }` placeholders are left as literal text.
:::

## The running number

The formula produces the fixed part of the code. The digits at the end come from a counter, and the
three numbering columns decide how that counter behaves.

**Code Sequence Prefix** is the counter's identity. Two records draw from the same counter when
their Code Sequence Prefix resolves to the same text — so
`{branch.code}-` gives you one independent counter per branch, while a constant `CUST-` gives one
counter for the whole company. The prefix is itself a formula, written in the same language. Leave
it empty and the calculated code doubles as the prefix, which is usually what you want.

**Code Suffix Length** is how many digits are appended, left-padded with zeros: `5` turns the
147th customer into `00147`.

::: warning An empty Code Suffix Length means no number at all
If you leave **Code Suffix Length** empty, nothing is appended — every record gets exactly the text
the formula produced. That is fine when the formula already yields something unique (a national ID,
a supplier's own reference), and a disaster when it does not. Any time you want a serial, fill this
column.
:::

**Suffix First Number** is where a brand-new counter starts. Leave it empty and the first record is
`1`; set it to `1000` and the first record is `1000`.

To find the next number the system takes the **last existing record whose sequence prefix is the
same**, strips the prefix off its code, reads what is left as a number and adds one. Two
consequences follow:

- If somebody has manually given a record a code that starts with the sequence prefix but ends in
  something that is not a number, the next save fails with a message naming that record. Fix the
  record's code and save again.
- If the number outgrows **Code Suffix Length** — a 3-digit suffix reaching 1000 — the save fails
  with a "prefix exceeded its maximum count" message. Widen the suffix (it is rejected on save
  above 20 digits) or start a new prefix.

### Code Validity Query

Sometimes "the next free number" is not enough — the code has to be checked against something else
before it is accepted. That is what **Code Validity Query** is for. The candidate code is written
onto the record, then the query runs; it should return **1 to reject the code** (the system adds one
to the counter and tries again) and **0 to accept it**.

The query is an ordinary Nama query, so it reads the record with `{ }` placeholders exactly like
the queries in [Criteria Based Validation](/platform/criteria-based-validation) — including
`{code}`, which by then holds the code being tested:

```sql
select case when exists
  (select 1 from Customer c where c.code = {code} and c.id <> {id})
then 1 else 0 end
```

::: danger The query must be able to return 0
A query that returns nothing at all, or always returns 1, never lets a code through. The system
keeps incrementing up to 99,999 times and then fails the save. Test the query on real data before
you rely on it, and always write it so that an acceptable code yields `0`.
:::

## Worked examples

### A branch-prefixed sequential customer code

The company wants customers numbered per branch: `RYD-00001`, `RYD-00002`, `JED-00001`.

| Column | Value |
|---|---|
| For Type | Customer |
| Code Calculation Formula | `{branch.code}-` |
| Code Sequence Prefix | *(empty — the calculated code is the counter)* |
| Code Suffix Length | `5` |

Because the code itself contains the branch, each branch automatically gets its own counter. The
147th customer opened in Riyadh is saved as `RYD-00147`.

### The same code with the year in it

Add the year and the counter restarts naturally every January, because the sequence prefix changes:

| Column | Value |
|---|---|
| Code Calculation Formula | `{branch.code}-{creationDate.$format."yyyy"}-` |
| Code Suffix Length | `5` |

`RYD-2026-00147`. The first customer created in 2027 becomes `RYD-2027-00001` without anybody
touching the settings — a new prefix has no previous record, so the counter starts again from
**Suffix First Number**.

### Building the name as well as the code

A warehouse register where the name should always read the same way:

| Column | Value |
|---|---|
| For Type | Warehouse |
| Code Calculation Formula | `WH-{branch.code}-` |
| Name1 Calculation Formula | `مخزن {branch.name1}` |
| Name2 Calculation Formula | `{branch.name2} Warehouse` |
| Code Suffix Length | `3` |

The name formulas only overwrite the names when they produce something; a formula that resolves to
nothing leaves whatever the user typed alone.

### An item code built from its category

Items are the one file that normally gets its formula somewhere else (see the next section), but
the formula text is identical wherever you put it:

| Column | Value |
|---|---|
| Code Calculation Formula | `{category1.code}-` |
| Code Suffix Length | `4` |
| Suffix First Number | `1` |

An item in category `BEV` is created as `BEV-0001`, the next one as `BEV-0002`, and an item in
category `SNK` starts its own run at `SNK-0001`.

## Keeping a code once it is assigned

By default the code is recalculated whenever the record is saved. That is usually harmless — the
formula produces the same text and the counter recognises the record's existing number — but it is
not what you want when the formula reads a field the user is allowed to change. Move a customer to
another branch and the branch-based code would be rebuilt under the new branch, orphaning every
document that already quotes the old code.

Tick **Do Not Reset Code With Update** and the whole calculation is skipped for records that have
been saved before: the code, the names and the alternative code stay exactly as they were, and only
brand-new records are coded.

::: info Codes arriving from Replication are never recalculated
When a record reaches this database through Replication it keeps the code it already has. The
formula only runs where the record is actually created.
:::

## Items have their own coding setup

Items do not start with this grid. When an item is saved the system looks first at the item's
**Item Section** — the section's own coding formula, or the first of its criteria lines that
matches. If nothing is defined there it falls back to the item coding formula held in the global
configuration, and only if **both** are empty does it come down to a Files Auto Coding line.

::: warning The revision and size/colour columns do not act from this grid
The revision code, the size-and-colour code, their four name formulas and the two
"…If Empty Only" switches are applied on the item's own coding path — the **Item Section** and the
global item coding formula. A Files Auto Coding line reached as the last resort codes the item
record itself and nothing else; the variant columns on that line stay inert.

If you are coding item variants, configure the formula on the **Item Section** and leave this grid
for the other master files.
:::

A section can also be told to **Prevent AutoCoding**, in which case its items are never coded
automatically at all, whatever any of these settings say.

## When the settings take effect

This is server-side behaviour. The moment the **Fields and Entities Settings** record is saved, the
next master file saved anywhere in the system uses the new formula — no restart, no sign-out, and
no action to press. Existing records are not touched: automatic coding only ever runs while a
record is being saved.
