# Input Rules and Limits

Every organisation ends up with rules about what may go into a field. Customer codes have a house
style, tax numbers have a shape the tax authority insists on, a delivery note is never supposed to
carry two hundred lines, and a remark field that was fine at 255 characters is suddenly too small
for the way one department works.

The grids on this page are where those rules live. They decide what a user is *allowed* to type and
how much of it. The important difference from the cosmetic settings on the sibling
[Field Appearance and Display](/platform/fields-and-entities-settings/fields-settings-field-appearance)
page is that most of these are checked by the **server at the moment the record is saved**. That
means they hold no matter where the data came from — someone typing on screen, a spreadsheet
import, or an outside system pushing records in through an integration. A rule that is only applied
by the browser can be bypassed; a rule applied on save cannot.

Every grid here starts with the same scope columns — **For Type**, **Entity List**, **On Field**,
**Inactive** — and they behave the same way everywhere. If you are not sure what "generic" means or
how a line is matched to a screen, read
[Fields and Entities Settings — Overview](/platform/fields-and-entities-settings/fields-settings-overview)
first; this page does not repeat it.

## Field Formats

This is the main input-rule grid, and the one you will reach for most often. You describe the shape
a value must have, and when someone saves a record whose value breaks that shape the save is
refused with a message explaining exactly which rule was broken. The user corrects the value and
saves again.

Say your customer codes are supposed to look like `CU-000431`: always starting with `CU-`, always
upper case, always between six and ten characters, letters and digits only. One line on Customer,
field `code`, with **Prefix** `CU-`, **Min Length** `6`, **Max Length** `10`, **Letter Case Type**
`Upper Case`, and both **Allow Numbers** and **Allow Alpha** ticked, and nobody can invent a code
that does not fit — not through the screen, and not through an import.

A tax number is the other classic case. Rather than describing it with lengths and prefixes you
give a single **Regular Expression**, for example `^3[0-9]{14}3$` for a 15-digit Saudi VAT number,
and the value either matches the pattern or it is rejected.

| Column | What it does |
|---|---|
| For Type | The entity this rule applies to, e.g. Customer, Sales Invoice. |
| Entity List | A named list of entity types, so one line covers several screens at once. |
| On Field | The field the rule guards, e.g. `code`, `remarks`, `details.item`. |
| Min Length | Values shorter than this number of characters are rejected. |
| Max Length | Values longer than this number of characters are rejected. |
| Allow Numbers | Untick to forbid digits anywhere in the value. |
| Allow Alpha | Untick to forbid anything that is not a digit — useful for numeric-only identifiers. |
| Prefix | The value must start with this text. |
| Suffix | The value must end with this text. |
| Criteria Definition | The rule only fires for records that match this criteria — see below. |
| Apply When Query | The rule only fires when this query matches — see below. |
| Letter Case Type | `All`, `Lower Case`, or `Upper Case`. Rejects values containing the wrong case. |
| Text Language | `All`, `Only Arabic`, or `Only English`. Rejects values written in the other script. |
| Lines Should Match | Restricts the rule to the grid lines the criteria or query actually matched. |
| Ignore Draft Suffix | Strips the draft marker from the value before checking it. |
| Prevent Leading White Space | Rejects values that start with a space. |
| Prevent Trailing White Space | Rejects values that end with a space. |
| Regular Expression | The value must match this pattern. |

An empty value is always accepted. Field Formats decides what a value must look like *if there is
one* — it never makes a field mandatory. If you want the field filled in, that is a different
setting.

### Making a rule conditional

The three columns **Criteria Definition**, **Apply When Query** and **Lines Should Match** exist so
that a rule can be narrow rather than universal, and they are worth understanding properly because
they work together.

**Criteria Definition** points at a saved criteria. Before the rule is applied, the system asks the
criteria whether this record is one it cares about; if the answer is no, the rule is skipped
entirely and the value passes. This is how you say "the tax-number pattern only applies to
customers registered in Saudi Arabia" — the criteria filters on the country, and customers
elsewhere are left alone.

**Apply When Query** does the same job with a query rather than a saved criteria, and it is
evaluated against the value being checked. You can use it on its own, or after a Criteria
Definition to narrow things further; when both are filled the record must satisfy the criteria
first and the query second.

**Lines Should Match** only matters when the field is inside a grid. Normally a criteria that
matches the record makes the rule apply to *every* line of that grid. Tick Lines Should Match and
the rule is applied only to the specific lines the criteria or query picked out, leaving the other
lines untouched. So on a Sales Invoice you can enforce a code pattern on the lines carrying a
particular item group without disturbing the rest of the invoice.

**Ignore Draft Suffix** is a small but frequently needed convenience. While a document is still a
draft the system appends a marker to its code, and a strict Max Length or Regular Expression will
trip over that marker and block the draft from being saved at all. Ticking this box removes the
marker before the check runs, so the rule judges the real code.

::: warning This screen does not obey its own rules
Field Formats never applies to the Fields and Entities Settings screen itself. A generic line on a
field name such as `code` will not lock you out of the very screen you would need in order to fix
it — but do not rely on that as a safety net anywhere else. A generic line with no For Type and no
Entity List really does apply to every other screen that has a field of that name.
:::

::: warning One rule per field
If two lines target the same entity and the same field, only one of them survives — they are not
combined, and the surviving one is not necessarily the one you expect. Put everything you want to
enforce for a given field on a single line, and keep that line in a single record. Splitting the
same field's rules across two records makes the winner unpredictable.
:::

::: tip It reaches the point-of-sale terminals too
A Field Formats line that targets Customer is carried down to the point-of-sale terminals along
with the rest of the customer configuration, so a code rule you set centrally is also honoured by
cashiers creating customers at the till. See [Nama POS — Overview](/modules/pos/pos-overview).
:::

Changes take effect as soon as you save the record — no restart and no action to press. Because the
check happens on the server, it applies equally to records arriving through
[Importing Records](/platform/import-export/importing-records). That is usually exactly what you
want, but it does mean a rule introduced today can block a routine import that has been running for
years, so it is worth testing an import once after adding a strict rule.

For help building the criteria and the query, see
[Criteria Based Validation](/platform/criteria-based-validation) and
[Criteria from Text Parser](/platform/text-criteria-guide).

## Field Allowed Values

Some fields are free text only because nobody ever got round to constraining them. A "Payment
Reference Type" that people fill with `cheque`, `Cheque`, `chq` and `check` is impossible to report
on. This grid turns an ordinary text, number, drop-down or entity-type field into a picklist: the
user gets a list to choose from instead of an empty box.

Each line carries up to ten values. If ten is not enough, add a second line for the same entity and
the same field and list the next ten — the values from all matching lines are merged into one list,
so twenty-five values simply means three lines.

| Column | What it does |
|---|---|
| For Type | The entity the picklist applies to. |
| Entity List | A named list of entity types, so one line covers several screens. |
| On Field | The field that becomes a picklist. |
| Allowed Value 1 … Allowed Value 10 | The values offered, one per column. Leave the unused ones empty. |
| Restrict Selection | Controls whether the list is a suggestion or a rule — see below. |

**Restrict Selection** is the column that changes the character of the feature. Left unticked, the
listed values are helpful suggestions: the user picks one with a click, but is still free to type
something else entirely. Ticked, the list becomes closed — only the listed values are accepted.
Start unticked while you are still discovering which values people actually use, then tick it once
the list is settled.

::: warning Restrict Selection is decided for the whole field, not per line
When several lines describe the same field, the restriction flag is combined across all of them. A
single ticked line makes the entire field restricted, even if the other lines for that field are
left unticked. If you split fifteen values across two lines, tick Restrict Selection on both, or on
neither — otherwise you will find values that look like suggestions being rejected.
:::

This one is applied by the browser, so a user who is already signed in will not see a new or
changed list until they sign out and back in. It is also worth knowing that the restriction is a
browser-side check: it stops people typing the wrong thing on screen, but it does not filter data
arriving through an import or an integration.

## Disabled Fields

The simplest grid on the screen. Name an entity and a field and that field is shown read-only: the
value is visible, but the user cannot change it.

| Column | What it does |
|---|---|
| For Type | The entity whose screen is affected. |
| Entity List | A named list of entity types, so one line covers several screens. |
| On Field | The field to show read-only. |

This is the right tool for fields that are filled automatically and should not be second-guessed —
a calculated total, a code the system assigns, a value copied down from a source document.

::: warning This is a convenience, not a security control
Disabled Fields is applied by the browser only. It stops a user editing the field on screen, and
nothing more. Data arriving through an import or an integration can still write that field, and so
can anything else that bypasses the edit screen. If a field must genuinely not be changed — because
of who the user is, or because the value is sensitive — use field security instead, which is
enforced on the server. See
[Field, Page, and List View Security](/platform/security/field-page-listview-security).
:::

There is also a global configuration option, **Allow Filling Disabled Fields with Creators**, that
lets the system's own automatic value fillers write into a field the user is not allowed to edit by
hand. It is normally left on: a user who may not type the branch manually should still get it
filled in for them. You will find it on the
[Security and Login](/platform/global-config/global-config-security) tab of the global
configuration.

Like the other browser-side settings, a change here only reaches a signed-in user after they sign
out and back in.

## Max Lines Counts For Documents And Files

A grid with no ceiling is an invitation to trouble. Someone pastes a spreadsheet into a Sales
Invoice and creates a document with four thousand lines that takes a minute to open, prints across
sixty pages and slows down every report that touches it. This grid puts a hard cap on how many rows
a named grid may hold, and the cap is checked on the server when the record is saved. The message
names the grid and the limit, so the user knows immediately what happened and by how much they are
over.

| Column | What it does |
|---|---|
| Field | The grid being limited, e.g. `details`. |
| For Type | The entity that owns the grid, e.g. Sales Invoice. |
| Entity List | A named list of entity types — see the warning below. |
| Max Lines Count | The largest number of lines allowed. Leave empty or zero for no limit. |

Two behaviours are worth knowing before you set a limit, because both of them are deliberate and
both save you from unpleasant surprises.

First, **the cap does not lock existing data**. If you set a limit of 200 and there are already
documents with 350 lines, those documents remain editable — the check only complains when a save
would leave the grid with *more* lines than it had before. Users can still correct a price on line
12 of an oversized old invoice; they simply cannot make it any longer.

Second, **documents the system generated as final are exempt**. When one document produces another
automatically, the generated document is not blocked by a limit meant for hand entry. The same
applies while records are being replicated between databases. Otherwise a limit set for the
convenience of data-entry staff would start breaking automated flows in the background.

::: warning The Entity List column does not work on this grid
Filling Entity List here does not currently spread the limit across the listed types. Use **For
Type** and add one line per entity instead. It is slightly more typing and it actually works.
:::

## Max Fields Length In DB

This grid does two related but genuinely different things, and you need to understand both before
you use it, because one of them is harmless and the other changes the database.

The first thing it does is **change the length the system will accept when a record is saved**.
Text fields have a standard size; if that size does not suit the way your organisation works — a
remarks field that needs to hold a long instruction, or conversely a reference field you want to
keep short and tidy — a line here raises or lowers it. A user who types more than the limit gets a
clear message that the input size exceeds the maximum size, naming both the length they typed and
the length allowed.

| Column | What it does |
|---|---|
| For Type | The entity that owns the field. |
| Entity List | A named list of entity types — see the warning below. |
| Field | The field whose length is being changed. |
| Max Length | The new length, in characters. |

The second thing it does is only available through the **Update Fields Max Length In DB** action at
the bottom of the grid. Raising the accepted length is not much use if the underlying storage is
still the old size, so this action goes through the lines and resizes the storage to match.

::: danger Update Fields Max Length In DB changes the database structure
This action alters the structure of the database directly. It is not a setting that can be quietly
undone, and on a large table it can take a long time and hold locks while it runs. Treat it the way
you would treat any structural change:

- run it **outside working hours**, when nobody is entering data;
- make sure a **current backup** exists and that you have checked it is restorable;
- have it run by someone who understands what resizing a column means for the system;
- shrinking a length is riskier than growing one — check first that no existing value is longer
  than the new limit.

If you are unsure, set the length in the grid, confirm the behaviour you want, and arrange the
action as a planned maintenance task rather than pressing it in the middle of the day.
:::

Only text-like fields can be resized: plain text, numbers, drop-downs, links, e-mail addresses,
passwords, colours and phone numbers. Anything else — a date, a checkbox, a reference to another
record — is refused, and the action tells you which field it refused and why, rather than failing
silently. It also tells you if it cannot find the entity or the field you named, which is the usual
sign of a typo in the Field column.

::: warning The Entity List column does not work on this grid either
For the length check applied on save, Entity List is ignored — use **For Type**, one line per
entity. (The resize action itself does read Entity List, which makes the inconsistency easy to miss:
the storage would be resized but the save-time check would not follow. Use For Type and the two
stay in step.)
:::

## Max POS Fields Length In DB

The point-of-sale terminals have their own storage and their own constraints. A receipt printer is
a fixed number of characters wide, a touch screen at a busy till has less room than a desktop
monitor, and a terminal that has to work while the network is down keeps its own copy of the data.
So the lengths that suit the back office are not always the lengths that suit the till. This grid
sets them separately.

| Column | What it does |
|---|---|
| POS Entity Type | The point-of-sale record whose field is being resized. |
| Field | The field whose length is being changed. |
| Max Length | The new length, in characters. |

There is also a **Field Type** column, but you do not fill it in — the system works out on save
whether the field is text or numeric and sets it for you.

The pleasant part is that you do not have to visit the tills. Once the record is saved, the change
travels to each terminal through Replication and is applied there, so a chain with forty branches
is configured once centrally rather than forty times over.

::: info Any line here makes the record travel to the tills
As soon as this grid has a single line, the whole Fields and Entities Settings record is marked for
Replication to the terminals. That is normally what you want, but it is worth knowing why a record
that previously stayed on the server has started appearing in the terminals' Replication traffic.
The same is true of Field Formats lines that target Customer.
