# Accounting Configuration (module option catalog)

Many of the accounting module's behaviors aren't coded — they're **configured** from the accounting module's configuration screen (Module Configurations → Account Configurations). This page is a reference catalog of the most important of these options, grouped by purpose: what each option does, and which behavior it changes. It's designed to answer the recurring support question: "where do I set this behavior?"

## For Support

- For any "where do I enable/disable this behavior?" question, start from this screen before assuming it's a code issue.
- Account and subsidiary options intersect with the [account](../accounts.md) setup itself; review both together.
- Period and closing options are complemented by the [Year-end & period control](../year-end-and-period-control.md) page.
