# How Service Queues Work

::: info Required licence
`srvcenter-service-queues`. Nothing on these pages is available on a base installation, and the licence also gates the endpoint the queue devices talk to — without it the kiosk, the display screen and the advisor stations are refused by the server.
:::

At 08:12 on 3 March 2026, Fahad Al-Otaibi walks into Al-Sahra Motors' reception hall with his Saif 1.6. He presses a button on a small tablet by the door and it prints him a slip that says **`A014`**. He sits down. A screen on the wall shows which numbers are being served and at which desk, with the dealership's own adverts rotating underneath. A few minutes later `A014` appears on that screen next to Majed Al-Qahtani's desk, Fahad walks over, and the visit begins — from there it is the ordinary [workshop job cycle](/modules/servicecenter/job-cycle/servicecenter-job-cycle-overview.md).

That is the whole of the Service Queues sub-module: a ticket, a display, and an advisor who calls the next customer. It is a small, self-contained feature and — unusually for something this peripheral — it works end to end.

You reach its two records from **Service Center → Queue Service**.

## The two records you set up, and the three roles they serve

Everything the queue does is driven by exactly two master files in Nama:

| Record | Arabic | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| **Queue Service Configurations** | إعدادات طوابير الخدمة | The rulebook: the queues themselves, which advisor may serve which queue, the display banners, the printed ticket design, and an optional self-service decision flow. |
| **Queue Service Branch** | فرع خدمة طوابير | The physical reception. Points at one configuration and sets the time the working day starts. |

A configuration is reusable — several branches may share the same rulebook. Al-Sahra has one of each: configuration `QSC-01` *Riyadh Reception / استقبال الرياض* and branch `QSB-RUH`.

Around those two records sit **three client roles**. They are not three products and not three licences — they are three modes that the same queue application registers itself in when it connects to the server. Setting up a reception counter means deciding which device plays which role:

- **Ticket creator** — the tablet or kiosk by the door. Its only job is to issue and print tickets. Al-Sahra keeps one at the reception desk, operated by the receptionist, and could add a self-service one facing the customer.
- **Display screen** — the wall screen in the waiting area. It shows the tickets currently in progress and rotates the banners you loaded onto the configuration. It carries the title you typed in *Screen Title*.
- **Service provider** — the advisor's or engineer's station. This is the one that pulls the next customer. The advisor signs in with an **engineer number** (positions 1 to 12), which is what the display uses to say *"ticket `A014`, desk 3"*. The same engineer number cannot be signed in twice at once, so two advisors cannot both claim desk 3.

::: info The queue apps are not Nama screens
The kiosk, the wall display and the advisor station are separate applications that talk to the ERP server. They are not screens inside Nama and they are not documented here — what *is* documented is everything you configure on the Nama side, which is all of it. If a device shows nothing, the question to ask is always the same: can it reach the server, and does the installation carry the `srvcenter-service-queues` licence?

## The life of a ticket

### 1. It is created

There are three ways a ticket comes into existence, and a branch may use all three at once:

1. **From the kiosk or the reception tablet** — the ordinary path. The operator (or the customer) picks a queue, optionally identifies the customer and types a plate number, and the ticket is issued and printed.
2. **Self-service by mobile number** — the customer types a mobile number and a plate number, and the server runs the configuration's **automatic ticketing** steps to decide what to do: recognise the customer, put them in the right queue, or refuse them with a message. This is the self-service flow described on the [configuration page](/modules/servicecenter/service-queues/servicecenter-queue-configuration.md).
3. **By hand from the branch screen** — a supervisor adds a ticket directly from the **Not Assigned Tickets** list on the branch record, using **Add Day Ticket**. Useful when a device is down or a customer needs to be slotted in.

However it was created, the ticket gets the next number in its queue, a printed code such as `A014`, a creation time, and — if they were supplied — a customer and a plate number.

### 2. It waits

The ticket now sits in the branch's waiting list. It is visible on the branch record under **Not Assigned Tickets / التذاكر اليومية (في الانتظار)**, and on the wall display as part of the waiting count.

### 3. It is called

An advisor presses *next* on their station (or a supervisor pulls the ticket for them from the branch screen). The server picks the next ticket like this:

1. **Anyone who has waited too long comes first.** If a queue has a *Max Time To Switch Queues* set and a ticket has been waiting at least that many minutes, it jumps ahead of the whole branch's waiting list regardless of its letter — oldest such ticket first. Al-Sahra sets 20 minutes on queue `A`.
2. Otherwise tickets are taken **in queue-letter order**, so `A` before `B`.
3. Within a letter, **oldest first**, and then by ticket number.
4. That candidate must be in a queue the advisor is allowed to serve, according to the configuration's **Queue Providers** grid. An advisor whose provider row leaves *Queue Code* blank is offered the first waiting ticket of **any** queue.

One more rule matters in practice: **calling the next ticket closes whatever the advisor still had open.** An advisor is never serving two customers at once, so if Majed pulls a new ticket while `A014` is still open, `A014` is stamped finished at that moment.

### 4. It is closed

A ticket can be closed explicitly — the advisor ends the visit, or signs out at the end of the shift, which closes everything still open in their name. But the real business path is different, and it is the one thing about this feature that surprises everybody.

## The ticket is closed by the job order — not by the service request

This is worth stating flatly because the opposite is the natural guess.

**The queue has no connection whatsoever to the [Service Request](/modules/servicecenter/job-cycle/servicecenter-service-request.md).** The service request is the appointment book: Fahad's visit was booked on `SCSR-2026-0881` two days earlier. That document carries no ticket fields at all, and committing it does nothing to any queue.

The link lives on the [**Job Order**](/modules/servicecenter/job-cycle/servicecenter-job-order.md). Its Basic Information group carries two fields — **Service Branch** (فرع الخدمة) and the ticket code — and when Majed raises job order `SCJO-2026-0417` for Fahad's car he picks branch `QSB-RUH` and then chooses `A014` from a suggestion list. **When that job order is committed, ticket `A014` is stamped finished and the wall display drops it.**

So the ticket is not closed when the customer stops standing at the desk. It is closed when the paperwork the visit produced is committed. On a busy day that can be an hour later, and the display will keep showing the ticket as in progress until it happens. If your advisors save job orders as drafts and commit them in a batch at the end of the day, your wall display will be wrong all day — commit the job order at the desk.

The link is covered in full, including what happens if the job order is later cancelled, on the [branches page](/modules/servicecenter/service-queues/servicecenter-queue-branches.md).

## Ticket numbering, in one paragraph

Each queue has a letter and a suffix length. Numbering restarts at the branch's **day start time**, and the **first customer of the day gets number 1** — printed as the letter followed by the number padded out to the suffix length, so with a suffix length of 3 the first ticket of the day is `A001` and Fahad's, later that morning, is `A014`. The **Last Number** on the queue is a hard ceiling: issue past it and the ticket is refused.

::: warning The *First Number* column has no effect
**أول رقم / First Number** on the queue grid is read by nothing. Type 100 into it and the first customer of the day still gets `A001`. Leave it alone; it is not a way to reserve a number range. Its neighbours *Last Number* and *Suffix Length* both work normally.
:::

## Printing

The ticket slip is a [report](/modules/servicecenter/servicecenter-reports-and-forms.md). The configuration names a **Ticket Design** — a report definition — and it is mandatory: no design, no configuration. When a ticket is issued, that report is rendered for the new ticket and is handed the **number of people still waiting in the same queue**, which is how a slip can print *"you are 6th in line"*. Set the ticket's font size on the configuration, and give the ticket-creator device the address of its local printer in **Printer URL** so the slip comes out of the counter printer rather than a server-side one.

## What the queue does not touch

Nothing here posts to the ledger, nothing moves stock, and nothing generates a document. The queue only annotates a job order that already exists. Tickets themselves are not documents either — they have no book, no code series, no draft-and-commit and no term. They are lightweight rows you can see, add, edit and delete from the branch record, and nothing more.
