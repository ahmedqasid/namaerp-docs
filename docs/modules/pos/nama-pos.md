# Nama POS — Technical Points of Use Guide

Nama ERP is a web-based system, but its **Nama POS** module includes a dedicated **desktop application** for Points of Sale (POS), offering both online and offline capabilities:

* POS operates offline using a local POS database.
* It automatically syncs with the Nama ERP central database.
* Integrates with payment terminals, including an embedded credit-card processor for mobile phones.
* POS functionality is available on Android and iOS via the **Captain Order** mobile app.

## Nama POS Pole Display Configuration Using Tempo


---

## POS Pole Display Setup

To configure a pole display for Nama POS, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **"Pos Pole Display Specs"** screen.
2. Set:

* **Communication Type**: e.g., Serial, USB.
* **Printer Name or Port Number**: to define the connection interface.
3. Link the pole display configuration to a machine by setting the **"Pos Pole Display Specs"** field in the machine record.

---

## Displaying Data on the Pole Display

Nama POS allows defining **template-based messages** for different events in the sales process. Templates are configured in the **"Pos Pole Display Specs"** screen.

### Supported Functions

* **Clear Line:**

```
@CLEARLINE@
```

Use it to clear one line on the pole display.

**Example:**

```
@CLEARLINE@@CLEARLINE@ Welcome
```

Clears two lines, then displays: `Welcome`.

* **Last Modified Line:**

```
{lastModifiedLine}
```

Use this to get the most recently added invoice line.

**Example:**

```
{lastModifiedLine.qty.value}
```

Gets the quantity of the last added item.

---

## Pole Display Templates

### Idle Template

Displayed when the POS is idle, before any invoice is created.

```
@CLEARLINE@@CLEARLINE@**** Welcome to Register {name2}
```

Clears both lines and shows a welcome message with the register's name.

---

### Line Adding Template

Displayed when a new item is added to the invoice.

```
@CLEARLINE@@CLEARLINE@
{padleft(20)}Item: {lastModifiedLine.item.name2}{endpad}
{padleft(20)}Qty: {lastModifiedLine.qty.uom.name2} - {round(lastModifiedLine.qty.value,0)}{endpad}
```

Shows item name and quantity info, padded for alignment.

---

### Total Template

Displayed when the Tender screen is opened (before payment).

```
@CLEARLINE@@CLEARLINE@
{padleft(20)}Total: {round(netPrice,2)}${endpad}
```

Displays the invoice total amount.

---

### Remaining Template

Displayed after the customer pays and change is calculated.

```
@CLEARLINE@@CLEARLINE@
{padleft(20)}Remaining: {round(change,2)}${endpad}
```

Displays the remaining change to be returned to the customer.

---

These templates provide a flexible way to control real-time messaging on POS displays using Tempo syntax.

## Filtering Search Screens in POS Using Machine Dimensions

In Nama ERP, access dimension filters (such as company, branch, sector, etc.) are applied automatically on standard screens. However, in the **POS system**, these filters are not applied automatically because the system relies on the machine's (register's) dimensions rather than the user's dimensions.

To enable filtering in POS search screens based on machine dimensions, use the **POS Settings** screen, specifically the **"Dimension Filtering"** table.

### Example:

Suppose you want to filter the **Zone (used in the delivery address)** in a **POS Sales Invoice** so that only zones linked to the current machine's branch are displayed:

1. Open the **POS Settings** screen.
2. In the **"Dimension Filtering"** table:

    * Add a new row.
    * Select the type **"Zone"** in the **Type** field.
    * In the **"Filtered In Type"** field, select **"POS Sales Invoice"**.
    * Enable the **"Filter by Branch"** option.
3. You can also create a **type list** containing "Zone" and other data types to apply the same filtering to all of them.

### Available Filtering Options:

* Filter by Company
* Filter by Branch
* Filter by Sector
* Filter by Department
* Filter by Analytical Group

## Logging In Using an API Key in POS

A new login mechanism has been added to the POS system using an **API Key** instead of a username and password. The purpose of this mechanism is to avoid storing the password (even if encrypted) inside POS configuration files, while ensuring the POS continues to work even after a password change.

This mechanism can be activated in two ways:

---

### Method 1: Automatic Creation via Traditional Login

1. Start the POS using the username and password as usual.
2. The system automatically:
   - Creates an `APICredentials` file
      - The file's code includes the user ID that was used.
   - Saves the API key inside the `nama.properties` file.
   - On startup, the system first looks for an `APICredentials` file with the matching code; if found, it uses it instead of creating a new one.

This method enables a smooth transition to API key login without any manual configuration.

---

### Method 2: Manual Creation

1. Create an `APICredentials` file manually and assign the user under whose name POS operations will be performed (reading/writing records).
2. Copy the key from the resulting file.
3. You can use the key in one of the following places:
   - Enter it in the initial settings window instead of the username and password.
   - Or place it directly in the POS `nama.properties` file:
     ```
     apiKey=dddsbddhbskbsdhdd
     ```

---

Using an API Key gives you greater flexibility and security, especially when updating passwords or managing a large number of POS terminals.

## Advanced Methods for Changing Sales Table Column Widths in POS

### Manual Method (Drag and Direct Edit)

- **How to use**:
  - Drag column borders manually (similar to Excel) to change the width.
  - When a width is modified for the first time, the system automatically saves the new values in the file:
    ```screenProperties.properties```
  - You can copy this file after adjusting all fields as required.

- **Deploying changes to POS machines**:
  - **Option 1**: Paste the file manually on each machine.
  - **Option 2**: Go to system settings → **Sales Column Properties** → paste the file contents → select **"Send Properties to POS Machines"** → save.

- **Advantages**:
  - Flexible and quick for initial adjustments.
  - Allows precise control based on user needs.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires manual intervention when updating across multiple machines.

---

### Controlling Width via POS Interface Settings

- **How to use**:
  - In the **"POS Interface Settings"** page, a new column named **"Width"** has been added for each field in the sales table.
  - You can specify the column size through predefined options (e.g., small, extra small, medium, large, etc.).
  - Space is distributed automatically based on the size specified for each field.

- **When to use?**
  - When you want to set widths in an organized way without manual dragging.
  - For proportional distribution of fields within the table.

- **What if you want manual dragging with this feature enabled?**
  - Leave the **"Width"** field empty, which allows the user to manually adjust the size at runtime.

- **Advantages**:
  - No manual editing required on each machine.
  - Provides predefined options for a consistent look across branches.
  - Automatically distributes space between fields.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Less flexible than the manual method in some special cases.

## Call Center & Item Add-ons

These two topics have moved to the operational guide:

- **Call center / electronic orders** — sending orders from one machine to another — is now part of [Tables, reservations & Captain Order](./pos-tables-and-restaurant.md#Suspended-orders-and-the-call-center).
- **Item add-ons** (extras, sizes, colours) is now its own page: [Item add-ons](./pos-item-addons.md).

## Resetting the Send Attempt Counter for Unsent Documents

When POS documents fail to send to the server, the system increments a failed-attempt counter (`writeFailures`). After 25 failed attempts (the default value), the system stops trying to send the document.

To reset the counter and allow the system to retry sending, run the following query against the POS database:

```sql
UPDATE POSSalesInvoice SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSSalesReturn SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSSalesReplacement SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSPaymentToRegistery SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSReceiptFromRegistery SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSShiftOpen SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSShiftClose SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSCustomer SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSStockTransferReq SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSOrderReservation SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSCreditNote SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSDiscountCoupon SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSStockTakingDetailsDoc SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSStockReceipt SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSScrapDoc SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSShortfallsDoc SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSError SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSInternalMessage SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
UPDATE POSInventory SET writeFailures = 0 WHERE sent = 0;
```

::: warning
Make sure to resolve the underlying issue that caused the send failure (such as network problems or server configuration) before running this query.

## Fingerprint Login

The POS system supports login using a fingerprint via the Digital Persona URU4500 device, allowing users to switch quickly and securely without needing to type login credentials each time.
