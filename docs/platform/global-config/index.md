# Global Configuration

Almost every other configuration file in Nama belongs to one module — supply chain settings shape inventory, HR settings shape payroll. **Global Configuration** is the one that belongs to all of them. It decides how many decimal places a number carries, whether stock documents may be edited after a closing entry, how a tax is calculated on an invoice line, who is allowed to log in and how, what a printed report looks like, and where attachments are stored.

That reach is what makes it worth reading carefully. A single checkbox here can change arithmetic on every invoice in the database, or hide a field from every screen in the system.

::: info Where to find it
Open **System Configurations** and choose the **Global Configurations** file (its code is `global`). Settings are grouped into tabs by theme, and each tab has its own reference page below.

## One record for the whole database

There is exactly **one** Global Configuration per database. It cannot be duplicated, and it cannot be given a second copy scoped to a particular company or branch — every setting on these tabs applies to the entire installation. When you change something here, you are changing it for everyone.

The values are **cached** for speed. When you save, the system refreshes the cached copy automatically, so a change takes effect without a restart. If you ever suspect a node is serving stale values, the **Reload Configuration** action on the General tab forces every node to re-read the record.

::: warning A few options deserve a second look
Some settings are marked as dangerous and ask for confirmation before they can be enabled — most notably the two options that allow reprocessing business requests dated before a closing entry. Others are effectively implementation-time decisions: the **Issue Cost Policy** lives in supply chain settings, but the **rounding tolerances** and the **tax calculation model** on these tabs are just as consequential, because changing them alters the arithmetic on documents that already exist. Read the notes on each option before changing it on a live database.

::: tip Options you may not see
Some options only appear when the matching licence is active. The replication options, for example, are hidden entirely on installations without the replication licence, and the eight line discounts appear only as far as your licensed discount count. An option described here but missing on your screen is almost always a licensing question, not a version one.
