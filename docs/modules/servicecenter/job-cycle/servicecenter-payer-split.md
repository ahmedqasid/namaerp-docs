# Who Pays for What

In an ordinary workshop the bill goes to whoever brought the car in. In a franchised dealership it
almost never does. One visit can easily contain a routine service the owner pays for, a failed
component the manufacturer's warranty covers, accident damage an insurer is settling, and a goodwill
gesture the dealership absorbs itself — all on the same vehicle, on the same day, on the same job
order.

Nama's Service Center handles that head-on. **Every operation line and every spare-part line carries
four percentages and four values**: customer, insurance, warranty and internal. The split is decided
line by line, it is checked when the document commits, and it is what the closing document totals and
what the three invoice buttons read. This page is the rulebook for it.

::: info Where you will meet it
The four percent-and-value pairs appear on the operations grid and the spare-parts grid of the
[job estimation](/modules/servicecenter/job-cycle/servicecenter-job-estimation.md), the
[job order](/modules/servicecenter/job-cycle/servicecenter-job-order.md), the *Add Task To Job Order*
document and the [job order closing](/modules/servicecenter/job-cycle/servicecenter-job-order-closing.md).
They do **not** appear on the service request — a booking has no opinion about who pays. Licence

## The columns

| Column pair | Arabic | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Customer % / value | العميل \| % / قيمة | What the person who owns the car pays |
| Insurance % / value | التأمين \| % / قيمة | What the insurer named in the document header pays |
| Warranty % / value | الضمان \| % / قيمة | What the warranty provider named in the header pays |
| Internal % / value | الشركة \| % / القيمة | What the company absorbs itself |

The insurance company and the warranty company are single fields on the document header, filled in
automatically from the
[vehicle file](/modules/servicecenter/workshop-setup/servicecenter-product-file.md) when you pick
the vehicle. There is one insurer and one warranty
provider per job order — you cannot split one line between two different insurers.

The split is applied to the line's value **after discounts**, not to its gross price. If you give a
10 % discount on a 380 part, the four shares divide the 342 that remains.

## The rule, stated once

Every time the document is saved, each priced line is put through the same three steps.

**1. An untouched line belongs to the customer.** If all four values are empty or zero, the line is
set to 100 % customer. This is the sensible default: type nothing, and the person who brought the car
in pays for it. It is also why a workshop that never uses insurance or warranty can ignore these
columns completely and nothing changes.

**2. The customer share is driven by its percentage.**

> customer value = line value × customer %

**3. The other three shares are driven by their values.**

> insurance % = insurance value ÷ line value (and the same for warranty and internal)

That asymmetry is not a typo and it is the single thing to remember from this page.

::: warning Type the customer's *percentage*, and the others' *values*
Because the customer share is computed from its percentage and the other three from their values, the
same number typed into the wrong box behaves differently:

- Typing **80** into *Insurance %* and leaving the insurance value empty does nothing useful. On save
  the percentage is recomputed from the empty value — back to zero — and the line then fails the
  commit check with an error about the percentage distribution.
- Typing a **customer value** without the matching percentage is likewise overwritten.

On screen this rarely bites, because the fields keep each other in step while you type: fill in
either box and its partner follows. The trap is everywhere else — an import file, a web service, a
data load from a legacy system. **Never load one side only.** Supply both the percentage and the
value for all four payers, or supply the customer's percentage and the other three payers' values.
:::

Finally, if the percentages come to 100 but the four values are a rounding fraction short of the line
price, the difference is added to the first non-zero share, in the order customer → internal →
insurance → warranty. That is why an odd unit price can leave the customer a fraction of a riyal
above the exact percentage.

## What the document refuses

On commit, for every priced line:

- the four percentages must total **100** (within a hundredth of a percent), and
- the four values must total the **line price**.

If either fails, the commit is refused and the error is reported against the **customer percentage**
column of the offending grid — so look at the whole line, not just the column the message points at.

Note the asymmetry with the estimation: the
[job estimation performs no checks of its own](/modules/servicecenter/job-cycle/servicecenter-job-estimation.md),
so a broken split can sit quietly on a quote and only announce itself on the job order built from it.

## The eight header percentage fields

The Details page of the job order carries eight percentage fields — customer, insurance, warranty and
internal, once for the operations grid and once for the spare-parts grid.

They are **one-shot bulk-apply widgets**. Type 100 into *Task Customer Percentage* and every line
currently in the operations grid is stamped with 100 % customer and its value recomputed. That is
their entire behaviour.

They are **not**:

- a default for lines you add afterwards — a new line ignores them completely;
- a policy that is re-applied when you save;
- read by anything downstream.

After you edit a single line, the header fields are stale and mean nothing. Use them as a fast way to
paint a grid, then forget them.

## The worked example

Fahad's job order `SCJO-2026-0417` is the canonical case. The story behind the numbers: *the routine
service is the customer's, the air-conditioning failure is under warranty, the alignment follows an
insurance claim, and the wash is a goodwill gesture the company absorbs.* The brake job is shared —
the pads were replaced early as a warranty gesture, the labour was not.

| Line | Line value | Customer | Insurance | Warranty | Internal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Oil change labour | 120 | **120** (100 %) | — | — | — |
| Engine oil 5W-30 | 160 | **160** (100 %) | — | — | — |
| Oil filter | 45 | **45** (100 %) | — | — | — |
| Brake labour | 180 | **180** (100 %) | — | — | — |
| Front brake pad set | 380 | **190** (50 %) | — | **190** (50 %) | — |
| A/C labour | 360 | — | — | **360** (100 %) | — |
| A/C compressor | 1,850 | — | — | **1,850** (100 %) | — |
| Alignment labour | 60 | — | **60** (100 %) | — | — |
| Wash labour | 60 | — | — | — | **60** (100 %) |
| **Totals** | **3,215** | **695** | **60** | **2,400** | **60** |

Every line's four percentages total 100 and its four values total the line price, which is exactly
what the commit check requires. 695 + 60 + 2,400 + 60 = **3,215**. ✓

Note the brake pad line: the operator typed **190** into the warranty value, and the customer
percentage **50**. Two different boxes, two different rules, one balanced line.

### The roll-up per operation

Each operation line also carries four system totals — its own share **plus** the shares of
[every spare part](/modules/servicecenter/spare-parts/servicecenter-spare-parts-overview.md) hanging
off it. These are the figures the closing document adds up, so it is worth being
able to read them:

| Operation | Customer | Insurance | Warranty | Internal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Oil change | 325 | — | — | — |
| Brake pads | 370 | — | 190 | — |
| A/C | — | — | 2,210 | — |
| Alignment | — | 60 | — | — |
| Wash | — | — | — | 60 |
| **Total** | **695** | **60** | **2,400** | **60** |

## What each share is finally used for

| Share | Where it ends up |
|---|---|
| **Customer** | The customer invoice; the closing's *Total Customer* box; **and the only amount the closing posts to the ledger** |
| **Insurance** | The insurance invoice, raised against the header's insurance company as the accounting الذمة; the closing's *Total Insurance* box |
| **Warranty** | The warranty invoice, raised against the header's warranty company as the accounting الذمة; the closing's *Total Warranty* box |
| **Internal** | The closing's *Total Internal* box, and nothing else |

::: danger The internal share is a memo figure, not an accounting entry
There is no invoice button for the internal share, no book, no
[term option](/modules/servicecenter/document-terms/servicecenter-terms-workshop.md) and no fetcher — nothing anywhere
generates a document from it. And the closing's journal entry carries the **customer** amount only.

So the 60 that Al-Sahra absorbed for Fahad's wash appears on one screen, in one box, and reaches the
general ledger by no route at all. If you need the cost of goodwill work in your accounts, you have
to raise that entry yourself.

The insurance and warranty shares are better off — but only because their
**[invoices](/modules/servicecenter/job-cycle/servicecenter-job-order-invoicing.md)** post them.
Skip the invoice and that money never reaches accounting either.
:::

The job order also tracks an invoicing status per payer. A payer whose percentages across all lines
come to zero is shown as **Not Applicable** rather than *Not Invoiced*, which is how you tell "there
is nothing to bill this payer" apart from "this payer has not been billed yet".

## Practical advice

- **Decide the split when you price, not when you close.** The closing copies whatever the job order
  says; correcting a split afterwards means deleting the closing, which is only possible while none
  of the three invoices exists.
- **Use the header spreaders for the common case**, then fix the exceptions line by line. Most job
  orders are 100 % customer with two or three warranty lines.
- **Check the totals before closing.** The four money boxes on the closing document are your
  reconciliation: they must add up to the job total.
- **Never split a line between two insurers.** There is one insurance company and one warranty
  provider per job order. Two insurers mean two job orders.
