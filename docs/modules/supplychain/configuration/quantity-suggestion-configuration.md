# Quantity Suggestion Configuration

This page documents the **Quantity Suggestion** tab. It controls two related behaviors:

- **Quantity suggestion** — when a user enters an item (or one of its properties) on a document line, the system looks up where that item currently sits in stock (lots, serials, sizes/colors, revisions, measures, warehouses, locators) and *suggests* the available quantities and which property to pull from.
- **Collect similar lines** — when documents are copied or consolidated, identical lines can be *merged* so the resulting document is shorter.

## Suggestion Order

When the system lists an item's available stock, it sorts the suggestions using up to three ordered keys, each with a direction. Each key can be:

- **Expiry Date** — order by the lot's expiry date (only when the item tracks expiry). Use for first-expiry-first-out, so near-expiry stock is suggested first.
- **First Receipt Date** — order by when the stock was first received. Use for first-in-first-out, so oldest stock comes first.
- **Search Property** — order by the property the user is currently entering (e.g. the lot/size/color being typed).

**First / Second / Third Suggestion Order** `value.firstSuggestionOrder` `value.secondSuggestionOrder` `value.thirdSuggestionOrder` *(defaults: Expiry Date, First Receipt Date, Search Property)* — the primary sort key and two tie-breakers, each with an **Ascending / Descending** direction (`value.firstOrderDescOrAsc`, `value.secondOrderDescOrAsc`, `value.thirdOrderDescOrAsc`). Set them to match your stock-rotation policy.

**Collect Property Order Configuration Lines** `value.collectPropertyOrderConfigLines` *(table)* — A per-property override of the three order keys above. Each line names a property (lot, size, color, warehouse, locator…), the field to sort its suggestions by, and the direction. When a line matches the property being searched, it fully replaces the three global keys for that property. Use it when one property needs a different sort than the global default.

## What Gets Suggested

**Add Quantity to Item Property Suggestion in Issues** `value.addQtyToItemDimensionsSuggestion` *(default on)* — Shows available on-hand quantities per property when entering an item on **issue/outgoing** documents (sales, stock issue), so the user can pick what to pull. Turn off to enter properties manually without the lookup.

**Add Quantity to Item Property Suggestion in Receipts** `value.addQtyToItemDimensionsSuggestionInRecipts` *(default on)* — The same for **receipt/incoming** documents (purchases, stock receipt), showing existing on-hand quantities while receiving.

**Use Quantity Suggestion Only in the Following Types** `value.addQtyToItemDimensionsSuggestionInTypes` *(table)* — Restricts the quantity suggestion to **only** the document types listed. Empty means no restriction (the two switches above apply normally).

**Consider Invoice Date in Quantity Suggestion** `value.considerInvoiceDateInQtySuggestion` — When on, the suggested available quantity is calculated **as of the document's date** rather than the live current balance — useful for back-dated documents.

**Show Only Non-Zero Quantities in Receipt Docs Suggestions** `value.showOnlyNonZeroQtiesInReceiptDocsSuggestions` — On receipt documents, suggestions can normally include properties with zero on-hand (so you can receive into a new lot). When on, only properties with a positive quantity are suggested.

**Consider Warehouse in Receipt Docs Suggestions** `value.considerWarehouseInReceiptDocsSuggestions` *(default on)* — On issue documents the suggestion is always filtered by the line's warehouse/locator; on receipt documents this happens only when this is on. Turn off to look across all warehouses while receiving.

**Unit Used for Quantity Suggestions** `value.unitUsedForSuggestions` — When no unit is on the line, this picks which item unit (primary, sales, purchase) the suggested quantities are expressed in.

**Set Total Quantity with Property Change** `value.addTotalQtyWithPropertyChange` — When on, after the user selects a property value (e.g. a lot), the line's quantity is auto-filled with the **total available** quantity for that property. Use it when users typically move the whole available quantity of the chosen lot.

### Don't Suggest Anything When There's No Stock

These switches apply on **issue** documents. When on, the property search returns the typed value as-is and does not propose alternative property values that have no stock — so you only issue what physically exists.

Each switch suppresses suggestions of the corresponding property when no quantity is available:

| Option | Field ID |
| --- | --- |
| Do Not Suggest Any Measures in the Absence of Quantities | `value.doNotSuggestAnyMeasuresInQtiesAbsence` |
| Do Not Suggest Any Boxes in the Absence of Quantities | `value.doNotSuggestAnyBoxInQtiesAbsence` |
| Do Not Suggest Any Lots in the Absence of Quantities | `value.doNotSuggestAnyLotInQtiesAbsence` |
| Do Not Suggest Any Revisions in the Absence of Quantities | `value.doNotSuggestAnyRevisionInQtiesAbsence` |
| Do Not Suggest Any Sizes or Colors in the Absence of Quantities | `value.doNotSuggestAnySizeColorInQtiesAbsence` |

### Filtering & Calculation Tweaks

**Calculate Measures Quantity Based on Transaction Unit Rate to Base Unit** `value.calcMeasuresQtyBasedOnTransUOMRateToBaseUOM` — For dimensional/measured items, computes the measures quantity using the transaction unit's conversion rate to the item's base unit, normalizing it when the entry unit differs from the base unit.

**Do Not Filter Warehouse and Locator by Dimensions in Quantity Suggestion** `value.doNotFilterWarehouseAndLocatorByDimensionsInQtySuggestion` — Normally suggested warehouses/locators are filtered by the document's dimensions (branch/department/sector). When on, that filtering is skipped so any warehouse/locator is suggested.

**Suggest Quantity in Locator and Warehouse** `value.suggestQtyInLocatorAndWarehouse` — When on, the locator/warehouse fields offer a per-locator / per-warehouse quantity suggestion. When off, the locator suggestion on stock issue is disabled. Turn on for warehouses that use locators.

### Assortment, Packing & Assembly Display

**Expand Item Assortment in Documents** `value.expandItemAssortmentInDocuments` *(table)* — For the listed document types, an "assortment" item (a bundle defining quantities per size/color) is automatically expanded into one detail line per size/color, with quantities multiplied by the entered quantity. Use when you sell pre-defined size/color packs.

**Show Packing List** `value.showPackingList` — Adds an extra "Packing" page to the inventory document edit screen for entering packing details.

**Show BOM Materials Only in Assembly Document** `value.showBOMMaterialsOnlyInAssembly` — When on, the assembly document only shows the materials belonging to the selected recipe (BOM), hiding unrelated entries.

**Show BOM Co-Products Only in Assembly Document** `value.showBOMCoProdsOnlyInAssembly` — The same restriction for the co-products defined by the selected recipe.

### Showing Property Names

**Add Color Name / Add Size Name / Add Revision Name** `value.addColorName` `value.addSizeName` `value.addRevisionName` — Each includes the human-readable *name* of the property next to its code in item-search/suggestion results. Turn them on when the codes alone are hard to read.

## Collect Similar Lines

When documents are consolidated or copied, identical lines can be merged into one. The grouping is controlled by which properties are treated as significant — turning on a property keeps lines **separate** when that property differs, and merges them when it matches.

**Collect Similar Request Lines in Consolidated Request** `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInConsolidated` — The master switch that enables merging request lines for the same item and unit when building a **Consolidated Purchase Request**.

Each option below adds the corresponding property to the grouping key, so lines differing in that property stay separate rather than being merged:

| Option | Field ID |
| --- | --- |
| Collect by Revision | `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInRevision` |
| Collect by Size | `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInSize` |
| Collect by Box | `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInBox` |
| Collect by Color | `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInColor` |
| Collect by Lot | `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInItemLotId` |
| Collect by Active % | `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInActivePercent` |
| Collect by Inactive % | `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInNotActivePercent` |
| Collect by Sub-Item | `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInSubItem` |
| Collect by Price Classifier 1 | `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInPriceClassifier1` |
| Collect by Price Classifier 2 | `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInPriceClassifier2` |
| Collect by Price Classifier 3 | `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInPriceClassifier3` |
| Collect by Price Classifier 4 | `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInPriceClassifier4` |
| Collect by Price Classifier 5 | `value.collectSimilarReqLinesInPriceClassifier5` |

**Collect Similar Issue Lines in Sales** `value.collectSimilarIssueLinesInSales` — When copying stock-issue lines into a sales document, identical lines are merged into one. Use it to shorten sales documents created from issues.

**Collect Similar Receipt Lines in Purchase** `value.collectSimilarRecLinesInPurchase` — The same for the purchase side — identical receipt lines are merged when building a purchase document.

**Aggregate Identical Lines of Quality Control / Assurance Documents** `value.collectSimilarLinesOfQualityContDoc` — When on, identical lines on quality control / assurance documents are combined into one.
