# Receipt, Payment and Request Document Terms

Receipt and payment vouchers are the most configured documents in the accounting module, and their
term is the longest in it — well over fifty options. Most of them answer one of four questions:

1. **Where does the cash side come from?** A fixed account, a safe, a bank account, the current
   user's custody, or an employee.
2. **What may the voucher carry?** Commercial papers, payment methods, invoices, instalments.
3. **What does the voucher copy** when it is created from an invoice, a request or another voucher?
4. **What else does it post?** Taxes, payment-method fees, extra lines.

The same term class serves the **Receipt Voucher**, **Payment Voucher**, **Receipt Order**, **Payment
Order** and **Bank Transfer**; the screen hides what does not apply to each. After it, this page
covers the payment and receipt **requests**, the **Electronic Receipt Voucher**, and the **cashier**
vouchers and shifts. The documents are on [Receipt & Payment Vouchers](/modules/accounting/receipts-and-payments),
[Banks, Bank Accounts & Transfers](/modules/accounting/banks-and-bank-accounts) and
[Cashier Shifts](/modules/accounting/cashier-shifts).

## The two sides of a voucher

A receipt voucher's **first side** is where the money arrives — the safe or the bank — and its
**second side** is who it came from. On a payment voucher it is the other way round. The term screen
follows that: on a receipt voucher term the first-side group is titled **Debit** and the second
**Credit**; on every other document of this family the first side is **Credit** and the second
**Debit**.

### First side

| Option | Field | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Account resource type** | `termConfig.sourceType` | Where the first side comes from — see the table below. |
| **Account** | `termConfig.account` | The fixed account, for **Specific**. The term cannot be saved with **Specific** and no account. |
| **Subsidiary account type**, **Account Bag Code** | `termConfig.sideSubsidAccountType`, `termConfig.sideSubsidAccBagCode` | Which of the safe's, bank account's or employee's accounts is used, when it has more than one. |
| **Safe Deposit** | `termConfig.safeDeposite` | The safe, for the **Safe Deposit** source. |
| **Bank account** | `termConfig.bankAccount` | The bank account, for the **Bank Account** source. |
| **Using Payment Method** | `termConfig.paymentMethodInRV` | **Must Use It**, **May Use It** or **Cannot Use It** — whether the voucher must, may, or must not name a payment method. Whatever the value, a payment method that belongs to a different safe or bank than the first side is refused. |
| **Payment Method** | `termConfig.paymentMethod` | A payment method the term applies to every voucher. When it is set, it replaces whatever payment method the user chose each time the voucher is saved. |
| **Prevent Insert Different Values Of Term Config…** | `termConfig.preventSaveDiffValuesOfTermConfigValues` | Locks the voucher to the term: its first-side safe, bank account or employee, and its first-side account, must be the ones the term gives. |
| **Calculate Account Based On Currency** | `termConfig.calcAccountBasedOnCurrency` | Picks the safe's or bank's account in the voucher's currency, whatever the account type. |

The **Account resource type** values:

| Value | What the voucher gets |
|---|---|
| **Specific** | The term's **Account**, filled in when the voucher's own account is empty. |
| **Bank Account** | The term's bank account and its account. The first side must be a bank account. |
| **Safe Deposit** | The term's safe, or the one the user picks. The first side must be a safe. |
| **Current User Subsidiary** | The employee linked to the user who created the voucher — the cashier's or collector's own custody account. It is set again on every save. |
| **Employee** | An employee the user picks; the account comes from that employee. |

### Second side

| Option | Field | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Related Subsidiary** | `termConfig.otherSideRelatedEntity` | The kind of party on the lines — Customer, Supplier, Employee, Bank Account, Owner, Broker or Contractor — used to work out line accounts. |
| **Subsidiary account type**, **Account Bag Code** | `termConfig.otherSideSubsidAccountType`, `termConfig.otherSideSubsidAccBagCode` | Which of the party's accounts the lines use. |
| **Detailed Voucher** | `termConfig.detailedVoucher` | Lets each line carry its own currency, amount and rate. |

### When the source document changes the accounts

**Account and Subsidiary Source Settings** `termConfig.accountAndSubsidiarySources` (receipt and
payment vouchers only) is a grid that overrides the second side's account type and bag code
depending on what the voucher was created from. When a voucher is created from another document, the
rows are read top to bottom and the **first** matching row wins. A row matches when:

- its **From Doc Type** `…fromDocType` is empty or equals the source document's type, and
- its **Apply When From Doc Matches Criteria** `…applyWhenFromDocMatchesCriteria` and **Apply When
  From Doc Matches Query** `…applyWhenFromDocMatchesQuery`, if filled, accept the source document.

The winning row's **Subsidiary account type** and **Account Bag Code** replace the term's, and its
**Calculate Subsidiary From Field of From Doc** `…fetchSubsidiaryFromDocField` names a field of the
source document whose value becomes the line's party. This happens when the voucher is filled from
its source, on screen; changing the grid later does not touch saved vouchers.

## What the voucher may carry

| Option | Field | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Commercial Paper Usage** | `termConfig.fbInRVPV` | **Must Use It**, **May Use It** or **Cannot Use It** for cheques and other papers. When papers are used, their total must equal the voucher total. Not shown on bank transfers. |
| **Allow Cancelled Financial Paper** | `termConfig.allowCancelledFinancialPaper` | Accepts papers in Cancelled status. |
| **Collected Cheques** | `termConfig.impliedCollection` | Papers skip straight to **Collected**: on a receipt voucher the received cheques, on a payment voucher the issued ones. |
| **Change Status To Portfolioed** | `termConfig.changeStatusToPortfolioed` | Receipt voucher: received papers go to **Portfolioed** instead of Received — for cheques deposited the moment they arrive. Has no effect when **Collected Cheques** is ticked. |
| **Do Not Copy Subsidiary to Commecrial Papaers Concerned Party** | `termConfig.doNotCopyConcernedParty` | New papers are not given the voucher's party as their concerned party. |
| **Allow Endorsing Received Temporary / Finally Bounced Cheques** | `termConfig.allowEndorsingReceivedTemporaryBouncedCheques`, `…FinallyBouncedCheques` | Payment voucher: lets a bounced customer cheque be endorsed to a supplier. |
| **Allow Multiple Payment Mehtods** | `termConfig.allowMultiplePaymentMethods` | Allows the payment-lines grid. Without it the grid must stay empty. |
| **Invoice Usage** | `termConfig.invoicesUsage` | Receipt voucher: whether **Invoices** or **Job Order** documents are offered when choosing what the voucher is "from". |

## Invoices, debt ages and instalments

| Option | Field | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Use From Doc For Debt Ages** | `termConfig.useFromDocForDebtAges` | The voucher settles the document it was created from. Cannot be combined with invoice rows on the same voucher. |
| **Do Not Use Invoices In Debt Ages** | `termConfig.doNotUseInvoicesInDebtAges` | The invoices grid does not settle debt ages. |
| **Do Not Check Invoices Total With Header Amount** | `termConfig.doNotCheckTotalInvoices` | Allows the invoices to add up to more than the voucher. |
| **Consider Lines Amount When Collecting Invoices** | `termConfig.considerLinesAmountWhenCollectInvoices` | *Collect invoices* spreads the line amounts over the invoices instead of the header amount. |
| **Fields Map For External Payment Added Lines** | `termConfig.fieldsMapForExternalPaymentAddedLines` | Which invoice fields are copied when an invoice adds itself to the voucher's invoices grid. |
| **Affect On Invoices Payment Value From Field** | `termConfig.affectOnInvoicesPaymentValueFromField` | (Effect tab) A decimal field of the voucher whose value is applied to the source invoices as paid, instead of the voucher amount. |
| **Apply effects on installments** / **Do not apply effects on installments** | `termConfig.applyEffectsOnInstallments`, `termConfig.doNotApplyEffectsOnInstallments` | Payment voucher and bank transfer: instalments are updated only when the first is ticked. Receipt voucher: instalments are updated unless the second is ticked. |
| **installment Effect** | `termConfig.installmentEffect` | Which instalment figure the voucher moves. |
| **Validate Remaining And Installments Total Equality** | `termConfig.validateInstallmentsTotal` | The instalment lines must equal the voucher total exactly. Without it they must only not exceed it. |
| **Do Not Check Total Installments With Total Amount** | `termConfig.doNotCheckTotalInstallmentsWithTotalAmount` | Switches both instalment checks off. |
| **Use Installment Lines For Debit Ages** | `termConfig.useInstallmentLinesForDebitAges` | Each instalment line settles the debt age of its document. |
| **Apply Effects On Parent From Doc…** | `termConfig.applyEffectsOnParentFromDoc` | When the voucher is created from a request or order, the payment lands on the invoice behind it. |
| **Update Remaining in RVPV Requests** | `termConfig.updateRemainingRVPVRequest` | Receipt and payment orders: the order's amount is added to the request's processed amount and taken off its remaining. |
| **Treat in Debt Ages Similarly To** + **Make Accounting Effect Payment Or Receipt Based On Debt Ages Treatment** | `termConfig.debtAgesTreatment`, `termConfig.makeAccountingEffectPaymentOrReceiptBasedOnDebtAgesTreatment` | Bank transfer only: whether the transfer settles debt ages as a payment or as a receipt, and — with the second option — whether its entry is turned round to match. |

## Copying from the source document

These options act when the user picks the document the voucher is "from"; they change what is filled
in on screen, not what the server checks.

| Option | Field | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Do Not Copy Details Of From Doc** / **Invoices** / **Installments** / **Commercial Papers** | `termConfig.doNotCopyDetailsOfFromDoc`, `termConfig.doNotCopyInvoices`, `termConfig.doNotCopyInstallments`, `termConfig.doNotCopyFinancialPapers` | Leave that grid empty. |
| **Fetch Lines / Invoices / Commercial Paper Based On Related Subsidiary** | `termConfig.fetchLinesBasedOnRelatedSubsidiary`, `termConfig.fetchInvoicesBasedOnRelatedSubsidiary`, `termConfig.fetchFinancialPaperBasedOnRelatedSubsidiary` | When copying from another voucher, bring only the rows of the voucher's related party. |
| **Do Not Copy Amount WithFrom Doc** | `termConfig.doNotCopyAmountWithFromDoc` | The source's remaining amount is not copied. |
| **Do Not Update Amount After Selecting From Doc** | `termConfig.doNotUpdateAmountWhenSelectFromDoc` | Keeps whatever amount is already on the voucher. |
| **Calculate Paid Value Instead Of Remaining Of From Doc** | `termConfig.calcPaidValueInsteadOfRemainingOfFromDoc` | Takes the source's paid amount instead of its remaining. |
| **Consider Amount When Copy Installments…** | `termConfig.considerAmountWhenCopyInstallments` | Copies instalments only up to the voucher amount. |
| **Do Not Change Amount When Selecting Salary Document In Lines** | `termConfig.doNotChangeAmountWhenSelectingSalaryDocumentInLines` | Payment voucher: choosing a salary document on a line leaves the line amount alone. |
| **Copy Lines Accounts From Subsidiaries With Term Config** | `termConfig.copyLinesAccountsFromSubsidiariesWithTermConfig` | When the term is changed, line accounts are worked out again from the lines' parties. |
| **Filter First Side Account By Currency** | `termConfig.filterFirstSideAccountByCurrency` | The first-side account search shows only accounts in the voucher's currency. |
| **Use The Document Header Currency Instead Of The Account Currency In The Lines** | `termConfig.useHeaderCurrencyInsteadOfAccountCurrencyInLines` | Lines keep the header currency and rate instead of their account's. |
| **Update Details Rate With Updating Header Rate…** | `termConfig.updateDetailsRateWithHeaderRate` | Changing the header rate updates the lines in the same currency. |
| **Can not modify Sector / Branch / Department / Analysis Set** | `termConfig.detailSectorNotModifiable` … `termConfig.detailAnalysisSetNotModifiable` | Locks that dimension on the lines on screen. |

## What else the voucher posts

| Option | Field | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Tax1 / Tax2 Debit / Credit** | `termConfig.tax1Debit` … `termConfig.tax2Credit` | Saved [side records](/platform/shared-master-files/accounting-side-config) that post line taxes as their own lines; the tax is then taken out of the line amount. |
| **Tax 1 / Tax 2 Is Deduction** | `termConfig.tax1IsDeduction`, `termConfig.tax2IsDeduction` | The tax is subtracted from the line net instead of added — withholding tax. |
| **Add Tax 1 / 2 To Total Debit / Credit** | `termConfig.addTax1ToTotalDebit` … `termConfig.addTax2ToTotalCredit` | Adds the line taxes into the voucher's total debit or total credit. |
| **Calculate Subsidiary From Parent If Needed** | `termConfig.calcSubsidiaryFromParentIfExist` | Ledger lines carry the line party's parent as subsidiary. |
| **Repeat Credit Side In Payment voucher Or Debit Side In Receipt voucher** | `termConfig.repeatCreditSideInPvOrDebitSideInRv` | The first-side entry is split into one line per voucher line, each with its own amount and narration, instead of one total. |
| **Expand Payment Method Effect** | `termConfig.expandPaymentMethodEffect` | Payment-method fees post as their own lines; without it the first side is netted by the fees. |
| **Add Line With Payment Method Fees Value / Fees Tax Value For Document Header** | `termConfig.addLineWithPaymentMethodFeesValueForHeader`, `…FeesTaxValueForHeader` | (Payment Method Fees and Tax Handling group) An extra line charges the fees, or the tax on them, to the header party. |
| **Fees Value For Dimensions Source And References Only** | `termConfig.feesValForDimensionsSourceAndReferences` | (Effect tab) The dimension sources and references used for the fee lines. |
| **Create Accounting Effects** | `termConfig.createAccountingEffects` | Receipt and payment orders: without it, the order posts nothing. |
| **Treated As Receipt / Payment Voucher Document With All Effects** | `termConfig.treatedAsReceiptVoucherDocWithAllEffects`, `…PaymentVoucherDocWithAllEffects` | The order behaves as a full voucher — papers, requests and ledger. |

## Payment and receipt requests

**Payment Request**, **Receipt Request** and their consolidated forms share a short term:

| Option | Field | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Subsidiary account type** | `termConfig.sideSubsidAccountType` | Which account of the party is used for lines brought in from an HR loan. |
| **Make Request Status Accepted With Save** | `termConfig.makeRequestStatusAcceptedWithSave` | Shown on payment requests: a new request is saved straight as **Accepted**, skipping approval. |
| **Generate Payment And Receipt Requests Automatically** | `termConfig.autoGeneratePVOrRVRequests` | Consolidated requests: each line generates (and keeps in step) a single request of its own. |
| **Automatic Generated Document Book / Term** | `termConfig.autoGeneratedDocBook`, `termConfig.autoGeneratedDocTerm` | Book and term of those generated requests. The book is required: *You must fill the book in term {0}*. |

## Electronic Receipt Voucher

The electronic receipt voucher records money that arrived by an electronic channel. Its single
**Effects** tab has a **Debit / Credit** pair (saved side records) and a **Commercial Paper
Creation** group: **Create Commercial Paper** `termConfig.createFinancialPaper` makes a paper for the
receipt in the chosen **Commercial Paper Book** `termConfig.fpBook`, on that book's bank account,
copying the fields listed in **Commercial Paper Extra Fields** `termConfig.paperExtraFields`. The
debt-age and instalment options in the same group — **Use From Doc For Debt Ages**, **Apply Effects
On Parent From Doc…**, **Do Not Check Invoices Total…**, **Use Installment Lines For Debit Ages**,
**Do Not Use Invoices In Debt Ages**, **Fields Map For External Payment Added Lines**, **Treat in Debt
Ages Similarly To**, **installment Effect**, **Do not apply effects on installments** — mean what
they mean on the receipt voucher.

## Cashier documents

The cashier documents are on [Cashier Shifts](/modules/accounting/cashier-shifts).

- **Cashier Receipt Voucher** and **Cashier Payment Voucher**: **Debit / Credit** (saved side
  records) `termConfig.debit`, `termConfig.credit`. A payment method can override one of the two —
  the side its own settings name.
- **Close Shift**: **Difference Debit / Credit** `termConfig.differenceDebit`, `…Credit` for the
  difference between the cash counted and the cash expected, and **Transferred Debit /
  Credit** `termConfig.transferredDebit`, `…Credit` for the cash handed over at the end of the shift.
