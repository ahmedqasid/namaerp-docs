# POS — Server-Side Setup

The rest of the POS guide is about the register: selling, taking payment, closing a shift. But every register is set up — and everything it does is collected — on the Nama server, under the **Point of sale** menu. That is where you decide which warehouse a register sells from, how its invoices are numbered, what happens to the cash when a shift closes, which accounts a sale posts to and what each cashier is allowed to do.

These pages are for the people who configure and support registers. They answer the questions that arrive as tickets: *"the shift is not reset at close"*, *"how do we change the invoice prefix?"*, *"why can't the cashier close the shift?"*.

## How the pieces fit

1. **The register** is a master file, one per machine. It names the warehouse, payment methods, terms and the many options that apply to that machine only.
2. **POS Settings** is a single screen of company-wide defaults. Wherever a register has its own value for the same option, the register wins.
3. **Supporting settings screens** — service charge, delivery cost, screen layouts, security profiles and the like — are separate records that the register or POS Settings points to.
4. **Documents** come back the other way. Each invoice, return, shift and payment a register saves is synced up and processed on the server through its document term.

Every change you make here reaches the registers through the normal data sync, so a register that is offline keeps the old values until it reconnects — see [How POS Data Syncs with the Server](../pos-data-sync.md).
