# When a Document Has No Accounting Effect

Saving an accounting document does not write its journal entry there and then. The save raises a
**business request**, and a background worker turns that request into the ledger entry a moment
later. When the entry is missing, the request is what you look at.

How requests work, what each processing status means, how to find the failed ones and what
**Reprocess** and **Recommit** each do is one page for the whole product:
**[Business Requests](/platform/background-processing/business-requests)**. Read it first — nothing
on this page repeats it.

What is specific to accounting is the list of reasons a ledger request refuses:

- **The period is closed.** The document's date falls inside a closed accounting period — see
  [Year-end and Period Control](/modules/accounting/year-end-and-period-control).
- **A Prevent Accounting Transactions document covers it** — the account, the subsidiary and the
  date range it names are all blocked while it is committed.
- **The account is not ready.** A subsidiary account with no party on the line, or an account whose
  balance nature is protected and would be broken by this entry — see
  [Accounts](/modules/accounting/accounts).
- **The document term is incomplete.** A side the term needs has no account on it, so there is
  nothing to post to.

Each of these is fixed on the thing that caused it, not on the request. Fixing the cause does not
retry anything by itself: the request stays failed until somebody reprocesses it.

::: tip The bulk reprocessing tool is not this
The administrative utilities that rebuild the whole ledger are recovery instruments for a database
whose balances are already wrong, run under supervision and with a backup in hand. A single document
with no entry is never a reason to reach for them — it is a single request on the Business Requests
screen.

The options that govern processing tolerance and closing with unprocessed transactions are catalogued
in [Accounting Configuration](/modules/accounting/support/accounting-configuration).
