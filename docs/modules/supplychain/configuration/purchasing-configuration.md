# Purchasing Configuration

This page documents the **Purchasing** tab — settings that affect purchase orders, purchase invoices, purchase returns, and the letter-of-credit / proforma workflow.

## Purchasing

**Copy Sector / Branch / Department / Analysis Set from Item** — When on, the line takes the corresponding accounting dimension from the **item's** own setup instead of inheriting it from the document header. Turn one on when items are pre-assigned to a dimension and you want lines stamped per item rather than by a single header value. *(These four switches are shared by sales and purchasing.)*

| Dimension | Field ID |
| --- | --- |
| Sector | `value.copyTranSectorFromItem` |
| Branch | `value.copyTranBranchFromItem` |
| Department | `value.copyTranDepartmentFromItem` |
| Analysis Set | `value.copyTranAnalysisSetFromItem` |

**Do Not Mark Purchase Request Processed** `value.doNotMarkPurchaseRequestProcessed` — Normally a purchase request is marked "Processed" once a purchase order/issue is created from it, so it no longer appears outstanding. When on, the request is left unmarked so it can feed several downstream documents.

**Do Not Mark Purchase Return Request Processed** `value.doNotMarkPurchaseReturnRequestProcessed` — The same behavior for purchase return requests, so one return request can be fulfilled by more than one return document.

**Do Not Save Purchase Documents if Item Not Purchasable** `value.doNotSavePurchaseDocsIfItemNotPurchasable` — When on, saving a purchase document is blocked if any line uses an item flagged "not purchasable". Use it to enforce that only approved items appear on purchase documents.

**Do Not Save Purchase Return Documents if Item Not Returned** `value.doNotSavePurchaseReturnDocsIfItemNotReturned` — When on, saving a purchase return is blocked if any line uses a non-returnable item.

**Allow Changing Receipt and Issue After Relating with Invoices** `value.allowChangingReceiptAndIssueAfterRelatingWithInvoices` — By default, once a stock receipt/issue line is linked to an invoice its key fields (item, quantity, warehouse, dimensions) are locked. When on, those linked lines can still be edited. Use with caution — it can desynchronise stock and invoice figures.

**Insert N1 / N2 / N3 in Purchase Invoice Lines** `value.insertN1inPurchaseInvoiceLines`, `value.insertN2inPurchaseInvoiceLines`, `value.insertN3inPurchaseInvoiceLines` — When on, the corresponding note/analysis text (N1, N2, N3) is copied from the **purchase price list** onto the purchase line when the item is selected. Use when you store extra descriptive or analysis text on purchase price lists.

**Update Tax Registration and Commercial Registration Number in Purchase with Save** `value.updateTaxRegNoAndCommercialRegNoInPurchaseWithSave` — When on, the supplier's tax-registration and commercial-registration numbers are refreshed from the supplier file onto the document each time it is saved, so documents always reflect current values.

**Calculate Purchase Return Prices** `value.calculatePurchaseReturnPrices` *(default on)* — When on, the system auto-fills unit prices on purchase return lines (from the last purchase price) where they aren't entered manually. Turn off only if you always enter return prices by hand.

**Must Match Line Unit with Purchase Price List Unit** `value.mustMatchLineUomWithPurchasePriceListUom` — When on, a purchase price-list price is used only if the line's unit of measure exactly matches the price-list line's unit, avoiding picking a price meant for another unit.

**Calculate Total Quantity in Purchases from Purchase Unit** `value.totalQtyIsInPurchaseUnitForPurchases` — When on, the document's total-quantity figure on purchase documents is expressed in the supplier's purchase unit (e.g. cartons) instead of the item's base unit (e.g. pieces).

## Letters of Credit & Proforma

These settings relax the locking rules around the letter-of-credit (LC) import workflow and its proforma invoices.

**Allow Editing in LC Proforma Invoice and LC Expense Document** `value.allowEditingInLcProformaInvoiceAndLcExpenseDocument` — When on, LC proforma invoices and LC expense documents can be edited even after the credit has been closed. Use cautiously, only to correct LC paperwork after closing.

**Allow Editing LC Proforma Invoice After Expense Documents** `value.allowEditingProformaInvoiceAfterExpenseDocs` — When on, the LC proforma invoice can still be edited after LC expense documents have been created against it.

**Allow Create Proforma Invoice Before Creating the LOC** `value.allowCreateProformaInvoiceBeforeCreateLOC` — When on, an LC proforma invoice can be created before the letter of credit itself exists, for workflows that prepare the proforma ahead of opening the credit.

**Use Proforma Invoice per Shipment** `value.useProformaInvoicePerShipment` — For multi-shipment letters of credit, when on the system uses a separate proforma invoice for each shipment instead of one consolidated proforma — useful when a single LC covers several shipments you want to document and cost separately.
