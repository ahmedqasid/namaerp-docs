# Document Management

Every business keeps paper it cannot throw away: signed contracts, commercial registrations, title
deeds, copies of national IDs. Somebody has to know which cabinet each one is in, who borrowed the
original last March, and when the licence needs renewing.

The Document Management System is the register for exactly that. The useful way to think about it
is **a catalogue of physical paperwork that happens to carry scans** — not a place to store files.
Nama already lets you attach a file to any record; these seven screens are for the documents that
also have a shelf, a custodian and a borrowing history.

Two things are worth knowing before you build a process on it. First, the document state is a
**label rather than a lock** — it tells you what the last movement said, and it stops nobody from
doing anything. Second, a **transfer does not actually relocate a document**: it records the
intention on the voucher and leaves the document's own shelf reference untouched. Both are covered
where they matter, and both change how you would design the day-to-day routine.

## Everyday Use

Registering paperwork, finding it again, and keeping track of who has it.

::: tip Looking for something else?
Attaching a file to an ordinary record — an invoice, a customer — is not DMS at all; that is the
standard attachment field, configured in
[Attachments and Storage](/platform/global-config/global-config-attachments.md) and per field in
[Fields and Entities Settings](/platform/fields-and-entities-settings/fields-settings-field-appearance.md).
And if you are looking for a way to delete old records rather than file them, that is data purging,
covered under [year-end and period control](/modules/accounting/year-end-and-period-control.md) —
a different thing entirely, despite the similar vocabulary.
